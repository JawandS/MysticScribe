REGIONS AND GEOGRAPHY TEMPLATE – **Zenith Empire (Western Xianxia World)**

---

## === WORLD STRUCTURE ===

**World Layout**

* *World Type*: Single “realm-macrocosm” (Primordial Draconic Realm) composed of many spatially-linked planetary masses that feel continuous to ordinary folk but appear as interlocking worlds to Divinities.
* *Size Scale*: Each of the 7 kingdoms spans **tens of millions mi²**; combined landmass holds ≈ **50 billion** inhabitants.
* *Travel Time*: Crossing one kingdom: **days** for an Immortal (mix of ground, sea, limited air transport). Air routes are few and Jade-hungry; dangerous wind shears force many travellers to stay ground-bound. Celestials/Divinities still favour air-ship entourages as a status marker.
* *Barriers*: Vast mountain chains, turbulent jet-stream strata, beast-infested wilds, and mana-rifts between planetary plates.

**Geographic Divisions**

* *Primary*: **7 Kingdoms** (Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Shadow, Light) – each ruled by its Pantheon.
* *Secondary*: **Duchies** (\~ 1 billion population each; 4–7 per kingdom).
* *Tertiary*: **Counties** (≈ 500 million), then **Provinces** (100–200 million) – daily governance by Celestial Governors. Below these lie cities, towns, and villages.
