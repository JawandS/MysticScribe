**Zenith Empire Government Structure**

## 1. Imperial Throne

* **Emperor**

  * Head of **State, Government, Military, and Church**.
  * Holds the combined **Legacy** of *Imperial, Divine, Might, Nobility, Prosperity*.
  * Strongest **Sovereign** in the Empire; inherits an accumulated legacy of all past Emperors who have ascended (collective wisdom + power).
  * Issues **Imperial Mandates** that override any law.
  * **Only check:** another Sovereign may compel the Emperor to ascend via a ritual duel inside a sealed sub-space deep within the Imperial Palace.

---

## 2. Executive Coordination

* Each major branch is led by a **Sovereign** who inherits a legacy tied to that post.
* These leaders convene as the **Prime Council** during emergencies to advise the Emperor and implement Imperial Mandates.

## 4. Lower-Level Governance

* The five-branch structure—**Bureaucracy, Church, Military, Senate, Grand Council**—is mirrored at **kingdom** and **province** levels (e.g., Royal Senate, Provincial Council).
* All subordinate branches report upward to their Imperial counterparts in **Sanctuary** (the capital).
* The Imperial Military operates as a single chain-of-command; provincial forces are branches, not independent armies.
