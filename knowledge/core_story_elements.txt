| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sentence Structure**    | Varied—mix of crisp action lines and longer lyrical sentences for description.                                                                                  |
| **Paragraph Length**      | Medium; action scenes ≤ 4 lines, reflection scenes 6-8 lines.                                                                                                   |
| **Description Density**   | Rich sensory detail for landscapes and Qi phenomena; moderate elsewhere.                                                                                        |
| **Narrative Flow**        | Smooth, escalating rhythm; each scene ends on emotional or plot hook.                                                                                           |
| **Vocabulary**            | Intermediate-advanced; fantasy-specific terms (Qi, dantian, Jade) clearly contextualized.                                                                       |
| **Dialogue**              | Slightly elevated frontier cadence; distinct vocabulary per class (noble formality vs. ranger plain-speak). Subtext layered—unspoken honor codes, hidden grief. |
| **Primary Tone**          | Serious, hopeful undercurrent.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Emotional Range**       | From quiet grief to fierce resolve; moments of camaraderie for relief.                                                                                          |
| **Atmosphere**            | Majestic wilderness, looming corruption; epic yet personal.                                                                                                     |
| **Tension Level**         | Steadily rising; spikes during beast attacks and duels, brief breaths for introspection.                                                                        |
| **Mood Variations**       | Action – intense & concise · Emotional – intimate · World-building – awe-tinged · Character growth – reflective.                                                |
| **Genre Conventions**     | Cultivation stages, formal duels, sect politics, resource quests. Avoid repetitive power grinding—focus on *meaningful* breakthroughs tied to emotion.          |
| **Innovation Areas**      | Western frontier aesthetic, Church education system, wind-tech ranger corps.                                                                                    |
| **Audience Expectations** | Clear power progression, dazzling Qi techniques, moral stakes, satisfying victories against corruption.                                                         |
