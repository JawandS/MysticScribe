## 1. Advancement Rates & Population Pyramid

| Metric                        | Ratio / Count                  | Notes                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Empire Population**   | \~50 billion (7 kingdoms)      | —                                                                                                                               |
| **Mystic Realm**              | 1 ⁄ 3 of population            | ≈ 16.7 billion first-class citizens.                                                                                            |
| **Immortal (Heavenly) Realm** | < 1 / 3 000 Mystics            | ≈ 100 000 Immortals per billion people each generation.                                                                         |
| — **Overseers**               | small subset of Immortals      | Regional administrators; not prestigious.                                                                                       |
| — **Legion Recruits**         | many stalled Immortals         | Join Legion to seek resources for advancement.                                                                                  |
| **Celestial (Eternal) Realm** | < 1 / 10 000 Immortals         | ≈ 10 Eternals per Immortal generation.                                                                                          |
| **Divinity Realm**            | Rare; relatively static number | Each kingdom’s Divinities form its **Pantheon**; the Empire’s collective Sovereigns sometimes called the **Imperial Pantheon**. |

* **Capital Distribution**

  * **Ducal Capitals (“Heavenly Cities”)** — dominated by Immortals.
  * **Royal Capitals (“Celestial Cities”)** — seats of Eternals and high-ranking Immortals.
  * **Imperial Capital Sanctum (“Divine City”)** — residence of most Divinities; they rule provinces via Governors.
* **Celestial Careers**

  * Commonly become Provincial Governors (realms of hundreds of millions).
  * Mortality causes: voluntary passing, inter-realm conflict, failed additional Insight.
* **Divine Turnover**

  * When a Sovereign ascends higher, fellow Pantheon Divinities often ascend together → vacuum promotes new Celestials to Divinity.
  * Emperor intervenes to shield the kingdom during the transition.
  * Monarch-rank Divinities periodically return to Royal Courts for championships, duels, or legal judgments.
* **Immortal Attrition**

  * Aging Immortals grow more violent; losses balanced by new Mystic ascensions.

## 2. Education & Childhood Progression

| Age Range   | Stage               | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 – 8**   | Family Rearing      | Poor regions: children accompany chores. Rich regions: early academics, martial arts, meditation.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **8 – 14**  | Schooling           | Formal in cities; informal village tutoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **14 – 16** | Independence Period | Imperial tradition for self-cultivation and academy prep. Rural education often ends here if resources scarce.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **16 – 21** | **Academy**         | Admission via **Imperial Exam**—tests **Body** (fitness), **Mind** (knowledge, acuity), **Soul** (potential), **Spirit** (current cultivation). Score dictates academy choice.                                                                                                  |
| **21 +**    | Post-Academy Paths  | • Anyone reaching Mystic realm at any age gains full civic freedom—may join a **Sect** or other body. <br>• Mortals ≥ 21 yrs may enter Institutes (wealthier zones) or Monasteries (cultivation-focused). <br>• Military service is a popular but lethal route for advancement. |

*Biological note:* Higher-realm cultivators find reproduction increasingly difficult as their bodies grow less human.

## 3. Village Culture

* **Demographics:** Predominantly mortal; a few resident Mystics if fortunate.
* **Mystic Roles:** Healers, blacksmiths, herbalists; often become mayors/elders or small-city entrepreneurs.
* **Daily Life:** Farming, logging, mining, herb gathering—monotonous, resource-driven.
* **Imperial Obligations:** Villages supply resource quotas in exchange for military protection.

  * In practice, corruption means affluent villages receive swifter defense.
* **Higher-Realm Presence:** Rare; villages generally govern themselves under minimal oversight.

## 4. City Culture

* **Heavenly (Immortal) Cities** bustle with power:

  * Flying cultivators overhead, casual Qi feats (e.g., vendor cooks food with fire breath; parent heals child with light Qi).
* **Hierarchy & Symbols:** Strict power ladder. Cultivators display emblems denoting rank/affiliation to deter random conflict.
* **Conflict Resolution:**

  * All cities host **arenas** for sanctioned duels.
  * **Sentinel Corps** intervenes to halt unsanctioned fighting swiftly.
