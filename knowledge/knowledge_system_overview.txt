=== KNOWLEDGE DOCUMENT HIERARCHY ===

PRIMARY REFERENCE (used by all tasks):
- core_story_elements.txt (core story elements, character consistency, writing consistency)

SECONDARY REFERENCE (task-specific):
- plot.txt (overall story arc, main plot framework, and themes)
- chapters.txt (chapter structure, pacing, and individual chapter guidance)
- World-building documents (context validation)

TERTIARY REFERENCE (background):
- user_preference.txt (author preferences)

This hierarchical structure ensures that core story elements remain consistent while allowing for detailed world-building and narrative development.
