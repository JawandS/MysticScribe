**CHAPTER 4 OUTLINE — "Echoes in Stone"**

**Target Length:** 2,000–4,000 words  
**Scenes:** 4 Total (each 400–1,200 words; see pacing notes per scene)

---

### Scene 1: The Summons (Opening — 400–700 words)

**Direct Continuation:**  
Begins immediately after Cassian, in the abbey infirmary, receives the sealed letter from the Ranger messenger (“From the High Deacon. You’re to appear when you’re able. They want your story.”). Cassian struggles to steady his hands, feeling the weight of the Ranger badge and Rygar’s sacrifice.

**Objectives:**  
- Cassian: Gather composure; fulfill Rygar’s last order by bringing the truth to the Church.  
- World-building: Sense of Windmoore — subtle Church influence, city atmosphere, the sacred obligation of confessions/testimony.  
- Emotional: Oscillation between new hope and stabbing grief; resolve hardening as he prepares to face authority.

**Obstacles:**  
- Cassian’s lingering trauma, self-doubt (“Am I strong enough to do this alone?”)  
- Church nurse hesitant to let him leave (“You’re barely on your feet. The city can swallow boys like you.”)

**Dialogue/Beats:**  
- Nurse warns: “The Deacon’s court is no warm hearth, Cassian. Innocence means little if you stammer or falter.”  
- Cassian quietly polishes Rygar’s badge, repeating a Church hymn under his breath (showing his mix of faith, nervousness, and ritual).
- Internal monologue: determination not to let his mentor’s sacrifice be wasted.

**Transition:**  
Cassian, upright and resolved, crosses the abbey’s threshold into a noisy, unfamiliar city — letter and badge in hand, cloaked in both loss and newfound purpose.

### Scene 2: Gates of Judgment (Church Court Introduction — 600–1,000 words)

**Setting:**  
Approach and entry to the grand Church complex in Windmoore: ancient storm-gray stone, dragon sigils, and wind-chimes clattering on sacred arches. Hundreds of citizens awaiting small judgments; Cassian’s rural awe and intimidation.

**Objectives:**  
- Cassian: Deliver message and badge; be recognized as witness/survivor, not dismissed as a traumatized orphan.  
- Plot/World-building: Show the layered social world—lines of mortals, mystics on higher platforms, Inquisitors moving with silent authority; Church’s real power in the city.  
- Plant seeds: hint at rumors circulating about beast attacks, Rangers missing, city tension over Imperial protection.

**Obstacles:**  
- Minor clergy nearly dismiss Cassian, thinking him a beggar or traumatized refugee.  
- When Cassian insists he’s “come on Ranger authority,” there’s tension — suspicion from a junior Inquisitor, who doubts the badge’s authenticity due to Cassian’s age and rural origins.

**Dialogue/Beats:**  
- Junior Inquisitor (cool, skeptical): “Many have claimed titles since the southern villages burned. Why should we heed a boy with a badge?”  
- Cassian draws on Rygar’s lessons, recounts specifics only a Ranger-in-training would know, speaks the Ranger’s oath under his breath.
- A high-ranking Church Deacon interrupts, recognizing the Ranger badge and the urgency in Cassian’s eyes. “Very well. Come. The High Deacon will judge your claim herself.”

**Internal/conflict:**  
Cassian’s self-doubt, surges of anger at not being believed, and flashes of memory (family, Rygar’s last words).

**Transition:**  
He’s ushered into an inner chamber. The doors close with the weight of fate.

### Scene 3: Testimony and Tithes (Central Inquiry — 700–1,200 words)

**Setting:**  
Cassian faces a semi-formal tribunal: the High Deacon (formidable, shrewd, unexpectedly kind), scribe, a silent Inquisitor in white, and acolytes. The chamber is lined with relics — old Ranger banners, wind-burnished swords. Outside, storm clouds gather, reflecting internal tension.

**Objectives:**  
- Cassian: Give full, honest testimony of village destruction, Rygar’s message, beast types, ward-failure, and hint at corruption (“the wards fell without warning — Rygar suspected why”).  
- High Deacon: Determine truth, test Cassian’s spiritual and moral clarity (subtle probes via spiritual pressure), decide whether to provide support or see him as a risk/liar.  
- World-building: Convey Church protocol, the process of investigation and spiritual aura/pressure in Windmoore.

**Obstacles:**  
- Cassian’s trauma risks making him incoherent or appearing unstable; the Inquisitor’s spiritual pressure is daunting.
- A moment of near-breakdown — flashback to fire and screams — where Cassian nearly fails to continue.
- Emotional risk: If Cassian loses composure, he may not be deemed trustworthy, possibly losing the Church’s support.

**Dialogue/Beats:**  
- High Deacon: “Truth is flame, boy. Hold to it, or be consumed.”  
- Cassian endures the pressure, steadies his breath, and relays Rygar’s dying advice and Ranger’s suspicion of higher corruption — omitting details that would incriminate Rygar directly (following last orders).
- The Inquisitor fixes him with an unblinking gaze; Cassian holds it, desperation mingled with resolve.

**Plot Advancement:**  
The High Deacon, moved but wary, says the Church will investigate further—“In times of shadow, Windmoore must discern where loyalty lies. If your words hold, you may find a place among the faithful...or something more.”

**Cliffhanger/Transition:**  
The Inquisitor quietly asks Cassian to surrender the badge “for sanctification”—its fate uncertain. Cassian hesitates, a moment thick with loss (the badge all he has left of Rygar), then nods, setting himself on a path with no return.

### Scene 4: Setting Stones in Wind (Resolution and Next Step — 400–900 words)

**Setting:**  
Cassian is temporarily housed in a novice dormitory or guest cell — barren, gray, with only a slim view of the city’s rooftops and distant mountains. 

**Objectives:**  
- Cassian: Reflect on what happened and what was lost (family, village, Rygar, now the badge), but also on the hope that the story may spark investigation and justice.  
- World-building: Foreshadow Church procedures — the significance of badge sanctification and investigation processes. Church acolyte delivers mundane comforts (a meal, basic supplies), hinting Cassian must now wait in limbo.

**Emotional/Character Development:**  
- Cassian is emotionally spent but determined not to break (“Hope does not betray the steadfast”). He repeats the Ranger prayer, meditating at sunset — the first stirrings of Wind Qi around him (sensory: breath of wind, chime on the window, subtle cultivation hint).
- Potential cameo: he notices a fellow youth watching him from another bed, a shy glimmer—planting the seed for a new ally/friend to emerge next chapter.

**Preparatory/World-building:**  
- Overhears whispers among acolytes: “New beast raids in the north. The Church is calling all hands. Promotion exams may be canceled. Rangers are stretched thin.”  
- Cassian reflects: if the Church does not act, he must find a way to pursue both strength and truth—setting up his drive to join the Academy and take control of his fate.

**Ending Hook:**  
Cassian looks out over Windmoore, uncertainty and determination warring in his heart. When he closes his eyes, the wind stirs again—faintly, as if calling his name. Cassian resolves: “If justice demands a gale, so be it. I will become the storm.” (Planting the next chapter’s dramatic escalation and the first real step on his cultivation path.)

**Pacing & Continuity Notes:**  
- Each scene flows directly from the last, with transitional emotional beats, persistent wounds (physical and psychological), and references to both prior events (Rygar, badge, village, beast attack) and the world’s broader tension (rumors, city, Church hierarchy).
- Dialogue consistently references Cassian’s outsider status, his rural worldview, and his struggle to balance grief and duty.
- Major chapter stakes: Whether Church will aid Cassian or leave him adrift; Cassian’s willingness to pursue justice no matter the personal cost; first seeds for Academy arc and new friendships/rivalries.

**Canonical Continuity:**  
- Directly continues from Chapter 3 (“His journey had only just begun.”)
- Maintains Cassian’s psychological trajectory, escalating from hope-tinged despair to emerging resolve.
- Integrates world-building details (Church authority, city culture, badge protocols, beast rumors) drawn from canon.
- Progresses plot and Cassian’s internal arc toward the first Pinch Point (Academy challenge, class prejudice, need for allies, path of cultivation).

**Word Count Breakdown:**  
- Scene 1: 400–700 words  
- Scene 2: 600–1,000 words  
- Scene 3: 700–1,200 words  
- Scene 4: 400–900 words  
- **Total:** ~2,100–3,800 words
