His second life began, appropriately, with death.

The pain announced itself first, a hooked chain yanking his infant heart so hard the rest of his body seemed an afterthought. He tried to scream, but air clogged behind gums that owned no teeth. The tug spread, lightning in water, drowning every other sense until nothing existed beyond the terrible pull.

Instinct, not thought, kicked in first, urging him to shove the agony back toward whatever dark shore had sent it. The attempt only tightened the hooks, dragging every nerve until sparks danced beneath his eyelids. His blood was boiling.

A cornered animal will sometimes leap into the hunter's jaws rather than run another step. He chose the leap. Acting on intuition, he pulled on the pain in the way a black hole pulls starlight, drawing the torment past skin and sinew into the hollow behind his heart.

The moment the pain crossed that threshold it changed texture, unspooling into dozens of silver threads. They raced along pathways he had no names for, tracing lattice‑lines through muscle, bone, and breath, as though mapping constellations beneath his flesh. Each thread cooled behind itself, leaving numbness where fire had raged.

By the time the last strand reached the base of his skull, the agony had bled into a steady chill, like winter water cupped between warm palms. Familiarity flickered: this was the same tug he had felt in quiet hospice rooms, the hush before final breaths, only now the volume was turned high enough to crack his very soul.

He kept the strange current moving, coaxing it into slow circles: up the spine, across the shoulders, down the arms, and back again. With every circuit it lost another razor edge, trading pain for weight, weight for strength. More of the force seeped in until it coursed through him like a tide that refused the moon's command.

Muscles thickened, vision sharpened a shade, and the frantic beat in his tiny chest settled into something measured. He realised the power was death itself, not come to claim him but to inhabit him, and he dared not let the river stagnate. So he breathed, and with every breath the current flowed, the pain a distant bell fading down a corridor of his own making.

Sight trickled back. Flames painted the horizon. He lay in the crook of a woman's elbow, swaddled in linen already darkening from soot and blood. Mere paces ahead, warriors in tattered robes and soldiers in ornate armour reminiscent of an Ancient Chinese warlord formed a circle around the birthing litter. Their swords hummed as though tasting the iron‑heavy air.

Beyond the ring of defenders the world split open, laying its horror bare. Tattered banners clung to shattered spears like shredded prayer flags, their sigils half‑obliterated by smoke. Trenches gouged by stray sword‑storms steamed where blood met molten stone, and what should have been grass now squelched under the slick weight of ruin.

Bodies, too many to count, lay sprawled with limbs at wrong angles. Armour gaped in flower petal shapes where claws had punched through, and viscera glimmered like dark jewels inside the rents. A horse, still harnessed to a splintered cart, twitched in small circles of reflex, its eyes already glassing over while black flies celebrated premature victory.

Demons moved through the wreckage with obscene grace. Some wore the suggestion of lupine shapes, yet all their fur had been peeled away, revealing muscle cords slick and pulsing as if breathing on their own. Their exposed teeth were too long, too many, crowding out tongues that lolled like strips of wet leather.

Others skulked hunched and two‑legged, cloaked in blue witchfire that burned without warmth. They possessed no faces, only smooth bone masks cracked by a single vertical eye, crimson and unblinking. Every step they took left footprints smouldering with ghostlight that ate slowly into the soil.

When these aberrations drew breath, the air itself seemed to toll. The sound was not a growl, nor a hiss, but the resonant clang of distant iron, the echo of temple bells struck to announce a funeral begun before the mourners had arrived. That wrong sound shivered through marrow and set the battlefield trembling, as if the land longed to retreat from the things defiling it.

The sky was red. Not the warm blush of dusk, but an arterial red, fresh and wet, the entire heavens turned into a wound. Bolts of jade lightning cut through black clouds. A robed elder traced sigils that became cyclones of emerald swords. Another punched open a gate of light that swallowed three demons whole. A third whistled, and the wind responded, tearing through ranks of the demon horde. He watched through blurred vision, awe blooming even as terror clenched tiny fists.

A fresh contraction of agony, not his own, tore the air. The midwives knelt beside a woman on a makeshift pallet, her robe once snow‑white, now crimson. Midnight hair plastered to waxen cheeks. She was a sunrise fading before anyone woke to praise it.

He knew, without recalling how he knew, that Death walked two steps behind her breath.
