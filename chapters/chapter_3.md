Chapter 3: Arriving at Windmoore

\* \* \*

A flicker in the trees—a glint of red, sharp and hungry as a knife point—rooted Rygar in place at the dying campfire. He squinted into the darkness. The blackness seemed to breathe around him, swallowing the weak glow of embers, swallowing his pain, swallowing even the hope that daybreak might bring sanctuary.

He gripped his wound with one hand, feeling the sick heat seeping from between his fingers. Blood, thick and tinged with shadow. Not enough time. Not enough strength left.

Cassian stirred at his side as a gust carried the sharp scent of pine and wet earth. The boy’s blanket slipped from his shoulders, exposing the faded green of his traveling tunic, now dirt-stained and torn. Cassian blinked awake, still caught between nightmare and reality. His eyes found Rygar in the gloom—and paused.

“What is it?” Cassian whispered, voice raw with lingering fear.

Rygar didn’t look away from the trees. “Stay still. If anything attacks, you run. No arguments.” The authority in his tone brooked no contradiction, but the boy’s jaw tightened regardless.

Cassian’s pulse thundered in his ears, the memory of burning walls and falling ash fresh behind his eyes. Run again? Leave another behind? But Rygar stood unflinching, back straight, a monument carved from fatigue and old duty.

Then the red light moved. Twin eyes, low to the ground, flickering behind brambles—followed by a shape, all sinew and warped fur. Another. And another. Four sets of predatory eyes, circling them in the predawn hush.

A low, guttural growl rippled through the air. Demonic-hounds. Rygar’s lips curled back, baring his teeth in answer.

“They smell the blood. Stay behind me,” he said, shifting his stance. Pain stiffened his movements, but he drew his sword in a single smooth arc—a motion Cassian had seen countless times, but never with such grim finality.

Cassian’s legs twitched, ready to bolt or fight. Not child. Not helpless. Not again. The promise burned beneath his ribs, small and stubborn.

“See how they move, Cassian,” Rygar murmured, never taking his gaze from the hounds. “They flank—never drop their stares. Wait for the lead to lunge. If you find an opening, take it. Don’t look back. You promise me that, boy.”

The words snagged in Cassian’s chest. He wanted to argue, to prove he could stand and fight beside Rygar, but the lesson in Rygar’s eyes rooted him in place. Not all courage is standing still.

“I promise,” he forced out, though shame burned his cheeks.

Rygar nodded, as if that were enough. He pressed something cool and heavy into Cassian’s palm—the battered Ranger badge, edges worn smooth by years of service. “Take it. Deliver it to the Church at Windmoore.” His hand lingered for a moment on Cassian’s wrist, rough fingers trembling. “Survive. It’s my last order.”

All protests died under Rygar’s stare. Cassian nodded, swallowing hard against the grief and old, ugly anger that threatened to break loose.

\* \* \*

Steel flashed. Rygar surged forward, meeting the hounds in the muck and needles beyond the fire’s last glow. Cassian saw only a blur—Rygar’s sword arm a streak of silver, the air shuddering as fur and fang collided with will and iron. The beasts snarled, circling, teeth bared against flashing steel. Rygar grunted, pain guttural in his throat, but held them.

Cassian hesitated a heartbeat longer, guilt roiling in his belly. I can’t just run—I can’t. The badge pressed cold against his palm, grounding him. Rygar’s order pressed colder in his mind.

Go.

He turned and bolted into the underbrush, branches scraping his skin. Heart in his mouth, vision tunneling, feet thudding clumsily over roots and stones. But the forest wasn’t silent. Behind him, the hounds howled—a sound stretched thin with hunger and rage. The rhythm of Rygar’s battle faded quickly, swallowed by shadows and distance.

Cassian crashed through the woods, desperate to find Windmoore before the darkness caught up. The wound from the past refused to heal: the burning village, mother’s arms severed from him by flame and falling roof. The guilt—a beast with sightless eyes—never far behind.

A snarl too close—he whirled, glimpsing a demonic-hound bounding through the brush with unnatural speed. He stumbled, catching himself on a low-hanging branch. His lungs burned; his legs barely remembered how to move.

Instinct screamed, but inside the panic something else stirred—a tremble, not of fear, but of memory. Rygar’s voice in training: “Draw breath until the world fills you. Then listen. The wind always whispers an answer.”

So Cassian tried. He sucked in air, sharp as knives. The world contracted, then expanded. He felt everything at once—the cold, the ache, the raw terror, but also something else, something bright. Energy, thrumming beneath his skin.

The hound lunged, slavering jaws snapping inches from his calf. Cassian slammed his eyes shut and let desperation become action. The badge clenched in his fist flared cold—was it only his imagination, or did it pulse with something more?

He leapt. This time, the wind seemed to catch him—Qi swirling in his chest, legs buoyed by impossible grace. He landed awkwardly on the other side of a narrow crevice, rolling in leaves and filth, but alive. The hound’s claws raked the earth where he’d stood an instant before.

Cassian scrambled up and plunged through the branches, leaving the snarling beast behind. The taste of power lingered, tangy and wild.

He kept moving, the edge of exhaustion only a half-step behind.

A fleeting glance at his reflection in a pool—moon-pale, rimmed with exhaustion. In his hair, a single filament glinted silver: a mark, perhaps, or a warning. He blinked, and the image was gone.

\* \* \*

As the world shifted from black to damp grey, the trees thinned and the ground sloped down toward a ribbon of road. Cassian clattered out of the brush, gasping, legs trembling. In the orange haze of sunrise, Windmoore’s walls rose before him—massive, stubborn things etched with old ward-glyphs and streaks of charcoal where some previous fire had licked too close.

For a moment he only stared, each breath a battle. The badge was in his palm still—Rygar’s last order, Rygar’s last hope, feeding him one more step.

His boots scuffed along the empty trade road, city walls looming higher with every stumble. The gates were half-shrouded in mist, guarding silence and secrets. Sentinels in blue-tasseled armor watched from their posts—were they real, or only more ghosts?

Cassian lifted the badge, arm quivering with effort. “Help,” he managed, voice breaking. “Ranger badge…hounds…the Church…”

One Sentinel—taller, beard bristling—exchanged a glance with his companion. A moment’s suspicion, then recognition. “Open the wicket. Quickly,” the first one barked, urgency fracturing the morning calm.

Cassian tried to take another step, but the world laughed, spinning away beneath him. He dropped hard to his knees, stone cold against his skin. Through his spinning vision, he saw the badge—sharp and solid, last tether to the living. Then darkness shuddered in, slow and complete.

Just before Cassian passed out, he thought—not for the first time—of Rygar’s words: Survive. That’s my last order.

\* \* \*

Wakefulness came piece by piece, measured out in light and quiet sounds. The air tasted of herbs—sharp, just shy of bitter. Linen sheets scratched against his forearms, far cleaner than anything he’d touched in weeks.

Cassian’s eyes fluttered open. Daylight crept through a small, high window, painting the walls with bands of sun. Across from him, an elderly man in city priest’s vestments adjusted a bowl of steaming broth.

“He’s awake,” the priest said softly, voice warm as old wool. “Easy now. You’re in Windmoore’s sanctum. Rangers found you by the gates just before dawn.”

The words swam in Cassian’s mind. Safe. For now.

He glanced at the bedside table—Rygar’s badge, cleaned and polished, glinted faintly. Its presence steadied him. Cassian reached out with trembling fingers and closed them around the metal, pressing it to his chest as if it might stitch together something broken inside.

“Where—Rygar?” he managed, throat dry as paper.

The priest’s eyes softened, sadness weighing down his neat features. “He did not come to our gates, boy. The badge and your message have been sent on. You did what had to be done.”

Cassian swallowed, sudden grief threatening to drown him. He blinked quickly, refusing tears. Instead, he flexed his fingers around the badge and made a vow.

“No more running. I’ll become strong enough. I swear it—no one else will die for me.”

The words felt thin at first—frail as spider thread—but they caught and held.

The priest watched quietly, then nodded. “Rest. Eat what you can. There will be questions soon, but for now—only healing.”

He left Cassian to the hush. Beyond the window, the bells of Windmoore sounded: iron and wind, chiming the hour into the waking city. Shadows crept short and then stretched again as the sun journeyed across the sky.

Cassian ate slowly, every movement deliberate—broth, bread, a cup of water, each a small return to life. With every swallow, he felt the echo of Rygar’s lessons—endure, persevere, adapt. Each pain, each ache was proof that he’d survived. And surviving, he told himself, was the first step.

That afternoon, a young woman—a Ranger, by the green sash at her waist—slipped into the infirmary. She studied Cassian with wary eyes, then held out a sealed letter. “From the High Deacon. You’re to appear when you’re able. They want your story.”

Cassian accepted the letter. His hands still trembled, but his heart felt steadier. The path was uncertain, the city vast and strange, but he would not falter. Rygar’s last order was not a burden, but a torch pressed into his keeping.

The wind at the window caught in the edge of the badge, setting it agleam for an instant, like a flake of dawn’s first light. Cassian smiled, almost against his will.

For the first time since the flames, hope did not feel like betrayal.

Somewhere beyond the walls, rumors whispered through the city—of Rangers lost, of demons at the border, of darkness stirring in the wild hills. But here, within stone and sun, Cassian gathered his strength.

His journey had only just begun.
