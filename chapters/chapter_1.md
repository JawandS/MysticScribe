### Chapter 1: Another Dawn

Dawn at the base of the soaring mountains was a blade of cold air.

It sliced through the pre-dawn gloom of the logging camp, raising gooseflesh on Cassian’s arms as he paused, axe held aloft. Below, mist coiled like a sleeping dragon in the valley, but up here, the wind was king. He waited, a ritual as ingrained as breathing, for its command. One gust, a searching whisper. A second, a playful shove. The third, a steady, powerful push.

He inhaled the sharp scent of pine resin and swung. The axe bit deep into wind-oak, the *thump-shiver* of the impact a familiar beat against the silence. It was hard, honest work, but his mind was rarely on the wood. Setting the axe down, he felt the muscles in his shoulders pulse with a familiar ache as he pulled a worn ledger from his pouch. Beside the charcoal smudges marking the log count for the imminent tax, his fingers moved with a life of their own. A few swift, furtive strokes, and the curved sail of a sky-ship bloomed on the page, a phantom chasing storms only he could see.

A heavy hand clapped his shoulder. "Dreaming won't fill the quota, boy," Jorek, the camp’s oldest woodcutter, grunted. "Overseer Rane's men don't count sketches."

Cassian forced a grin, tucking the ledger away. The name Rane left a sour taste in his mouth, the ghost of a man known only by his ever-increasing demands. Beyond them, a blur of people indicated a Ranger squad on patrol, their presence a stark promise of safety. A sudden, icy current of air snaked around his neck, a touch of winter in the growing warmth of morning. The world seemed to hold its breath.

He shook off the unease, though it clung like a splinter beneath the skin. Dawn's wind was usually a gentle caress, soft and familiar. Today, it pressed sharper. It carried warning in its touch.

Dusk settled, and the village square came alive with the flickering orange glow of swaying lanterns. The air, thick with the smell of roasting meat and woodsmoke, vibrated with the shrieks of children chasing paper breeze-kites.

"You'll bring the entire forest to the table if you don't wash," his mother scolded, her voice stern but her touch gentle as she ruffled his hair. Flecks of sap went flying as her calloused fingers went to work with familiar patience.

"Captain Cassian, ruler of the skies!" his younger sister, Tessa, crowed. She had filched his sketchbook and was now parading it around the fire pit, a ten-year-old whirlwind with his father's gale-blue eyes. Cassian feigned a lunge, his heart swelling with a fierce, quiet love.

"Let the boy eat, Tess," his father admonished, stirring the stew. His smile was warm but his eyes were distant, seeing the impending quota and the ever-looming shadow of Overseer Rane. "The Imperial Army can have him for their sky-ships soon enough."

The cheerful hum of the square faltered. Laughter died in throats as a figure emerged from the twilight, his presence bringing a heavy blanket of silence.

Corporal Rygar Stormwake moved with the careful deliberation demanded of those in the Ranger Corps. His gaze, a restless, stormy grey, swept over the gathered villagers. 

Rygar stepped close to Elder Karra, voice low beneath the crackle of the bonfire. "When was the last time the detection formation was renewed?" She didn’t meet his gaze. Her reply came soft, hollow. "Overseer Rane’s jade shipment, it’s still delayed." His jaw tensed. "Third month running?"

Before Karra could answer, Tessa’s voice broke through the silence, high and trembling. “Are we going to be okay, Elder Karra?”

Rygar straightened. The lines around his eyes tightened as he forced a smile, firm and false. "Of course, little one. Everything is just fine."

Far above, etched into the mountainside, the glowing channels of ward-light flickered, as if something vast veiled in shadow had passed.

\* \* \*

Midnight came with an absolute, ringing silence. Cassian awoke in his cot, his heart pounding against his ribs. The wind was gone.

A low, percussive *thump. thump. thump.* vibrated through the floorboards. He scrambled to the window just as a crackling explosion of green lightning emerged from the nearest ward in the detection formation.

A shriek tore the air, not of a beast but of the realm itself crying in pain. A wound of crimson light opened in the square. From its depths spilled shapes of running shadow: Demonic-Hounds, their massive paws silent on the packed earth, their eyes glowing with fierce insanity.

The house erupted with unholy flames, hissing as they incinerated thatch and wood. He saw his mother, her leg trapped beneath a fallen beam, her eyes wild as she searched for him across the chaos. He saw Tessa screaming, clutching her arm.

"Cass!"

He dove toward them, his hands scrabbling at the heavy oak. He strained, muscles screaming, and the beam shifted. But the roof above groaned, then collapsed in a torrent of fire and splintered wood. The last thing he saw was his mother's hand, reaching, before she was gone.

The world continued to dissolve, fire roaring, sobs tearing his throat raw. Through the smoke, Cassian saw his father rise, stance wide, and hurl a logging axe with the fury of a man who saw his world collapse. The weapon spun end over end toward an onrushing hound, its fangs slick with blood of another. It didn't slow. Cassian screamed as his father fell, swallowed by shadow and flame.

As his legs gave out a hand seized his collar, hauling him from the mud. "Go now! There's nothing you can do!" Rygar's voice was a thunderclap. His sword sang, a silver arc of sword-wind erupting, bisecting two hounds.

Cassian ran, numb and stumbling, the world behind him a funeral pyre.

\* \* \*

Deep in the forest, veiled in quiet shadow, Cassian collapsed to his knees. His stomach lurched and he doubled over, retching into the moss, his hands trembling. The sickness beat inside his skull, clung to his skin like soot and blood that should have been there.

Through the trees, past the gnarled veil of wind-oak, the village still burned. Its glow pulsed dimly, flickering like a dying heart.

A branch cracked.

Cassian flinched and scrambled back, a broken gasp escaping his lips.

"Stay quiet, boy," came a low, ragged voice.

Rygar staggered into view, one arm clutched tight against his side. Blood soaked his leathers, dark and thick. His breath rasped like torn canvas.

Cassian froze, heart hammering. "How—what happened—are they—" The words tangled and broke in his throat.

"There was nothing more I could do," Rygar said quietly, grimacing as he sank to one knee. "There were too many… I think…" He shook his head. "I think we’re all that’s left."

But the words didn’t land. They passed through Cassian like the breeze through a torn sail. His eyes were fixed on the gash beneath Rygar’s arm, the blood still flowing. Wordless, he pulled his cloak free and pressed it hard against the wound.

Rygar hissed, but didn’t stop him.

Cassian worked by instinct, hands moving in short, clipped motions, binding the cloth, tightening the wrap. There was no room for memories this moment. No room for screams or fire or reaching hands.

Rygar watched him in silence, face drawn, the lines around his mouth deepening.

After a while, he spoke again, gentler this time. "Cassian..."

"No." The word snapped out sharper than steel. Cassian's jaw was tight, his hands shaking as he tied the last knot in the cloth. "Don't."

Rygar didn't press.

Instead, he leaned back against the roots of a tree, breathing through his teeth. For a long moment, the only sound was the wind returning, rustling the canopy above them like a forgotten lullaby.

"We need to keep moving. Windmoore’s the closest city. If we push hard, we might reach the outer ridges in a few days."

Cassian didn’t answer, but he nodded a single time. Mechanical. Hollow. All he could see was ash and flame.
