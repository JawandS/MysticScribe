Ash drifted in the waking light, sifting down through the blackened trunks and stitching feathery patterns across the shredded earth. Cassian woke to the taste of char in his mouth and the echo of a scream caught halfway between dream and memory. He lay for a moment, still as a stone at the edge of a vanished stream, surrounded by the ruins of what had been home. The air was sour with burnt things—old lives, old hopes—muffled beneath the constant, weary rush of the wind.

A boot nudged Cassian’s leg. Rygar loomed above, face shadowed by the hood he’d pulled low against the ash. Though his words were quiet, they sharpened the air like splinters. “On your feet, lad. Dawn’s giving us half a head start, if we’re lucky.”

Cassian struggled up, legs rubbery beneath him. The band of his satchel bit into his shoulder; something hard and knotted twisted in his chest, and he pressed his lips together to keep the sound back. He blinked at the crooked ring of trampled grass where they’d collapsed, dazed and shivering, hours before. The charred remains of a campfire, a coil of frayed rope, clung to the edges of vision—points of stubborn, ordinary detail in a world gone hollow.

Rygar crouched to examine the dressing beneath his battered cuirass, fingers blunt and methodical. Cassian caught a glimpse of the wound: slick, angry flesh ringed with angry purple, veins darkening toward midnight black. Rygar sucked in a slow breath and rolled his shoulder as if testing its limits. The motion was careful, almost tender. “Survival’s never pretty, Graves,” he rasped, not looking at Cassian but letting the words fall between them. “You’ll learn that soon enough.”

Cassian said nothing—he only followed with numb, dragging care as Rygar shoved essentials into his own battered pouch. Food, if it could be called that: hard bread, a strip of smoked rabbit, a dented flask. Cassian glanced at the few possessions scattered near his feet. A cracked lantern, a half-finished sketch, Tessa’s ribbon—a sun-bleached scrap, still faintly pink. He wound it tight around his palm and tucked it deep into his pocket.

Rygar slung his bow over one shoulder, movements betraying a stiffness that grew with every hour. “No noise. Move with the wind, not against it. We’ll use the tree line—keep under cover, but don’t linger. Take only what you can’t live without.” He looked squarely at Cassian for the first time. “We buy your sorrow time with footsteps, nothing more. Don’t waste it.”

They left the remnant camp without another word. Somewhere behind, the hint of warmth—the kind found only in laughter or in the press of a sibling’s hand—crumbled to dust. Cassian cast a final glance back: blackened roots gripping at the earth, a burned Ranger badge caught half-buried in the cinders. Tessa’s laughter lived for a heartbeat in the wind, then faded as Rygar motioned him to start down the edge of the gully.

The woods pressed close. Each branch wore its shroud of soot, stripped bare, limbs raised in silent accusation. Ash settled on Cassian’s lashes until he brushed it away, squinting through the haze. The ground crunched bitter underfoot, littered with splinters and the warped shards of talismans—protection spells shattered by some power far greater than the scattered villagers had ever summoned.

He walked where Rygar’s boots left half-moons in the mud, measuring each breath, each footfall. When the silence threatened to fold in on itself, Cassian counted heartbeats, then wind gusts, marking time as he once had waiting for Tessa to finish a story by the fireside.

An hour passed. Maybe two. Rygar said little, his only words the clipped commands of a man with no room left for comfort. “Step wide—there, roots.” Or: “Keep sharp now, lad. This wood’s not empty.” 

Cassian’s mind slipped sideways into feverish memory: Mother’s hand rough in his hair; Father’s shout; Tessa’s voice trailing off into singing. Each thought burned hot as the last embers left in the soil. Once, he stumbled over an uneven root and nearly fell; Rygar caught his arm before he crashed into a snag, steady but unsparing. “Keep awake. Fear keeps a man alive, boy. For a time, at least.”

The wind shifted. Cassian sniffed—an undercurrent threaded the air, sharp and animal. Rygar halted, crouching by a low tangle of roots. He scraped at the ground and found dung, fresh and steaming—a scabbed claw-print gouged into the gray. “Not a bear,” Rygar murmured, scowling, “nor wolf. Something hungrier.”

They pressed on, moving faster, until a brambled stream cut the path between shale banks and half-drowned saplings. Rygar wheezed as he bent to fill the flask. Cassian saw the edges of the corporal’s wound and froze. The veins grew blacker still, twisting out from the gash as if some shadow had rooted itself within. Rygar’s fingers trembled, but he forced the flask to Cassian.

The quiet, always fragile, cracked. Cassian stared at the water’s rippling surface. “Why didn’t the wards hold?” His voice was strange, as if it belonged to someone else. “Our mystic said they’d keep us safe.”

Rygar’s face turned to stone. For several heartbeats he simply stared at the break in the trees. “No Jade, no power,” he said, the bitterness in his tone failing to mask old resignation. “Ward-stones run dry. Towns like ours get what’s left, if anything. Most go without. Sometimes it’s not enough even for the chosen.”

Cassian’s hands curled into fists. “Who decides who gets them?” The edge of anger in his voice surprised even him.

Rygar let a shadow flicker across his eyes; his gaze drifted to the hollow east, where a spindly line of burnt towers marked the remains of an old Empire relay station. “Overseer Rane’s supposed to assign the stones,” he answered at last, voice turned low as if the wind itself had ears. “But power likes to linger with those who already have it. Out here, the Empire allocates what it must, and seldom more. So you keep that name under your tongue, boy. Speak it only when you have strength or proof at your back. The Empire listens; it doesn’t often forgive.”

A pulse of thunder grumbled in the far hills—real or imagined, Cassian could not tell. Rygar’s shoulders tightened; he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then gestured toward a thicket beneath an arcing willow. “Storm’s coming,” he said, hoarse. “We camp here. Night moves quicker in the wild.”

Dusk slid through the canopy, a drawn-out wash of smoky gold and slate. Cassian and Rygar worked with silent efficiency, stripping dead branches from the edge of the glen but not daring a fire. Rygar laid out palm-sized talismans—simple things etched with lines and tiny chips of pale jade—beneath the roots, a faint blue glow guttering around them like the last line of defense.

In the camp’s heart, Cassian poured half their water into the battered basin, washing blood and ash from Rygar’s side. The wound pulsed with unnatural cold. Rygar’s eyes fluttered for a moment, and Cassian nearly lost his grip on the gauze. His hands stung; sweat traced lines down his temples, sticky with dread.

Rygar woke with a start and seized Cassian’s wrist. “Don’t look so grim, Graves. I’ve endured worse. Served under a Legion surgeon once who stitched a man with moon-ivy and hammered in prayers with a brick.” He managed the ghost of a grin.

Cassian didn’t laugh, not even a little. He pressed clean cloth to the festering skin and struggled to anchor his thoughts. “Did you ever think… it’d not be enough? That you might fail?”

Rygar’s brow creased, the bravado slipping. “Failure sharpens you, if you let it. Or it kills you if you won’t learn. I was Academy-bound once myself. Flunked the entrance trial three times—every time made me meaner, cleverer.” His voice softened. “It’s easy to worship the Rangers or the Legions. Folk see the medals, but not the scars. Truth is, scars are the price, and some of us are chosen by nothing but our losses.”

Cassian hesitated. The ribbon in his pocket seemed to burn. “What’s it like… to be strong?” he asked, the whisper nearly carried away by the breeze.

Rygar’s gaze drifted up, following the willow’s bowed limbs, their leaves trembling in the dusk wind. “Strength’s a story folk tell to keep the dark away,” he said quietly. “When I opened my third eye—barely sixteen, bone-scrawny as a crane after storm—didn’t see the glory. Just pain. The world split itself open and for a moment, the Qi flowed through all my broken places. That’s the first step, if you want to be more than a Mortal. Mystic Initiate comes only after you survive being less than human a while.”

He brought out a battered stone and placed it, almost reverently, at Cassian’s feet. “This is all the power you’ll own for a while: endurance. Let yourself break—don’t stay broken. The wind passes through what’s shattered, and in the space it leaves, you find something new.”

Cassian listened, heart pounding despite the chill. The past was a ruin, but in Rygar’s low, scraping words, he tasted a different future. Some seed of conviction kindled in his chest—a fragile, angry light.

Rygar reclined, eyes flickering. “The Rangers clear the wilds so others don’t have to count the cost. They endure what others can’t stomach. That’s all there is, Graves. It ain’t medals or legends. It’s holding together when every wind tries to knock you down.”

Night deepened, shrouding all the world outside their talismans’ glow. Cassian spoke, the words tumbling out—uncertain but true. “If I survive this, I’ll find a way to keep it from happening again.” The vow trembled at the end like a thread in a gale.

Rygar rustled, voice gentle now. “Serve. Endure, then serve. That’ll carry you farther than any bit of Jade.”

The world shrank—the scrape of cloth, the hum of insects, Rygar’s breath. Sleep stole over Cassian in thin, uneasy drifts. He dreamed of burning houses and women’s cries chased away by wind. Then, abruptly, a hand shook him. Darkness pressed heavy against his eyelids.

“Wake,” Rygar whispered fiercely. “Something’s tracking us. Not beast—I’d know the tread. Might be a scout. Maybe worse.”

Cassian forced himself upright, limbs prickling cold. Rygar’s jaw set in a line; he rummaged for the bow and slung it clumsily over his shoulder. “Fast now, no talk. Take only what’s yours.”

They disassembled camp in clumsy silence—every motion painfully loud. Cassian carried most of the weight, grimacing. Rygar leaned heavier on him as they moved, yet his eyes still saw through the predawn fog, wary and sharp. Branches clawed at their boots. Cassian clutched the old badge Rygar had thrust into his hand—a shape heavy and cold with someone else’s hopes pressed into metal.

Mist rippled at the edge of vision. A sound—half growl, half whisper—ghosted behind them and vanished as the wind shifted.

Their scramble up the ridge was a blur of scrambling hands and gasped breaths. At one point, Cassian caught his ankle in a tangle and nearly pitched sideways, only Rygar’s quick grab keeping him upright.

He didn’t slow. The dread at their backs was more than mortal animals; some weight pressed on the air. Cassian dared a glance over his shoulder, and for a heartbeat, he saw two motes—red as coals—floating in the gloom, watching. Or maybe they were only embers, memory ghosts birthed of grief and exhaustion. When he blinked, they were gone.

Cassian’s lungs ached; his legs shook. Rygar faltered twice, then rallied, teeth clenched. “No more nights in the wild, Graves. Windmoore or we’re bones for the crows.”

Above the ridge, the sky broke—strips of sullen gold and pewter. There, beneath the lowest clouds, lay Windmoore’s city walls: the wards shimmered faintly, pulses of blue-yellow circling the great gates like spun gold. Far off still, but visible—a promise inked against the wreckage of the past.

Cassian sucked down the damp air, chest tight yet hungry for more. If he could just keep moving, put one step after another, he might find out what strength was. The vow inside him, kindled an hour before, flared: Survive. Fight—for the ones who couldn’t. Endure, and one day, make it right.

Behind, the woods were waking. A shift in the branches, a hush broken by something not quite wind. Cassian walked faster, Rygar’s weight warm at his side—a burden, but also a tether.

Dawn split the trees, and with it came the future—uncertain, dangerous, caught between hope and the steady rhythm of fragile footsteps in the ash.
