Chapter 2: The Journey to Windmoore

Dawn crawled across the sky, dragging a pale cold morning in its wake.

Cassian jerked awake, breath catching. His muscles protested as he sat up, every joint stiff. Memory quickly followed: flames, ash, and screams. 

Rygar sat nearby, failing to enter a meditative state, the wound in his side pulsing in an ominous black. "We need to move," said Rygar, voice raw from a day spent in ash. It wasn't a suggestion. 

Cassian nodded. He understood. Movement was more than survival, it was hope.

They gathered their things in silence. Even the trees seemed to lean away from the direction of the former village.

\* \* \*

Rygar moved with grim purpose, one hand clamped over his side. Each step was deliberate, his boots dragging through fresh growth. His face stayed tight and unreadable, but the tremble in his arm told the truth.

Cassian followed close behind, eyes scanning the ruined woods, ears tuned to the hush between wind gusts. The forest offered nothing, no birds, no beasts, no threats. Just the sound of their own breath and the brittle crunch of their steps.

Time slipped past without words. Occasionally, Rygar paused, leaning on a charred trunk, his breath sharp and uneven. Cassian offered a hand without speaking. Sometimes Rygar took it. Other times he waved it off with a glare, his pride hanging by a thread.

They came to a stream no wider than a boot. The water was clear but shallow, barely moving, reflecting the scorched canopy above. Cassian crouched at the edge, cupped his hands, and splashed his face. The chill steadied him, clearing the fog in his head.

He felt Rygar's gaze before he looked up.

"Why didn't the detection formation warn us?" Cassian asked. His voice cracked, low and dry.

Rygar hesitated, eyes distant. "We didn't have the jade to power it."

Cassian stared at him. "What?"

Rygar didn't meet his eyes. "Couldn't afford it."

The words sat heavy in the air. Cassian felt heat bloom in his chest. "Whose fault was that?"

"It doesn't matter," Rygar said, voice rough. "They're gone. You can honor them by surviving."

Cassian rose slowly. His hands curled into fists. "That's not enough. Was it your fault? Did you fail us?"

Rygar's head shot up, eyes dark and fists clenched . "It was Overseer Rane," Rygar snapped, jaw tight. "Always has been. He withheld the jade. Left us defenseless."

He stepped forward, jaw tight. "What are you going to do? Challenge him? He's two realms higher - his glance alone would be the end of you."

Cassian's anger faltered. Shame crept in, slow and cold. He looked away, throat tight.

"I'm sorry," he said.

Rygar turned, pressing his hand harder to the wound at his side. His voice was quieter now.

"We can't stop moving, the demons might not have been purged yet."

\* \* \*

The sun retreated, hiding behind the thick veil of night. Camp was a rough patch of earth with a simple fire to heat a recently caught rabbit.

Cassian unwrapped Rygar's bandages. The wound was angry: flesh swollen, shot through with black, spiderwebbing veins that pulsed with every heartbeat. The sight froze him.

He tried to clean it, hands careful but clumsy. Rygar gritted his teeth, letting out sharp breaths. The silence grew heavy and awkward.

"Did you leave anyone behind?" Rygar asked. His voice had lost its edge, quieter now, almost gentle.

Cassian shook his head, eyes stinging. "They were all there. When the fire cameâ€¦ all of them."

Rygar gave a slow nod, eyes closing for a moment. "Everyone carries a loss that won't let them rest," he said, his voice rough with old weight. "That's why I became a Ranger. Why I joined the Academy."

Cassian looked up, surprised. Rygar almost never spoke about his past. The mention of the Kingdom's Military Academy hung in the air, a ripple in the silence neither of them had expected.

"It taught you how to fight?" Cassian asked, tentative.

"It taught me discipline," Rygar said, drawing the word out as if he could taste the memories it contained. "Showed me how to push past what I thought I could endure. And when you go further than you thought possible... you find out who you really are."

Cassian wondered what he would find, if pushed. Fear twisted in his chest. Not just of dying, or failing Rygar, but of surviving, of what kind of person would be left if everything else was burned away.

Rygar caught his look. "Strength isn't just Qi and Mystic Arts. It's surviving when you want to break. It's finding a reason to get up every time the world knocks you down."

Cassian nodded, not sure if he understood, but wanting to believe.

\* \* \*

Somewhere in the darkness, a branch snapped, a predator, or the forest reminding them that not everything in the forest was as easy to kill as a rabbit.

Rygar's hand closed around Cassian's shoulder, fierce for a man so weakened. "Quiet," he hissed.

Cassian's heart pounded, blood hot in his ears. He fumbled with a sharp stick he had scavenged on their journey.

They waited. The night pressed close, silent for a heartbeat, then two. In the hollow between breaths, Cassian caught movement, a glint, red as a coal, blinking from deep between the trunks.

He wanted to believe it was just an animal, but the images of demonic beasts were burned too deep. Rygar's fingers twitched, trying to summon what little Qi remained in his scorched spirit veins.

Then the eye blinked and vanished. The forest seemed to exhale, a gentle breeze filling the silence. Rygar's voice came low and steady, cutting through the quiet.

"We need to talk."

Cassian turned toward him, wary. "About what?"

"You're fifteen, maybe sixteen," Rygar said, not unkindly. "And you haven't started cultivating."

Cassian looked away, heat rising to his face. "No. I haven't."

Rygar gave a slow nod, expecting the answer. "It's not your fault. I know how isolated your village was. How hard you all worked, just to meet the next quota."

He shifted, his hand tightening on the bandage at his side. "But if you're going to make it to Windmoore, and if you want to stand a chance once you get there, you'll need more than desire. Being a Base Mortal isn't enough."

Cassian swallowed. "The elders mentioned Qi once or twice. Said the first step was sensing it, but we never had time to sit and meditate. There was always another tree to fall, another cart to load."

Rygar's expression softened. "You'll have time now. You need to make time."

He closed his eyes for a moment, letting his breath settle. "When I entered Qi Awakening, it was like something inside me finally opened. I could feel the world breathing with me. Every inhale pulled more than air, it pulled the energy of reality itself: Qi."

Cassian leaned forward, captivated. "I heard a few in the village managed it, but they never spoke of it openly. Most didn't want to be seen neglecting their duties."

"That's not uncommon," Rygar said. "But once you can feel Qi, truly feel it, your journey begins. Then you start refining the body. You cleanse it, temper it, train it to hold power. That's how you prepare to become a Mystic."

"And after that?" Cassian asked, his voice quieter now. "No one back home ever made it that far."

Rygar let out a tired breath, somewhere between a chuckle and a sigh. "One step at a time, lad. Finish Body Cleansing and Body Refinement, then we'll talk."

He leaned back, eyes flickering toward the stars above the trees. "Rest. If we make good time tomorrow, Windmoore's within reach."

Cassian wrapped his blanket tighter around his shoulders and lay down beside the fading fire. For the first time in days, the ache in his chest loosened. He imagined Qi in the air around him, waiting. The thought was strange, wondrous. For the first time since the flames, something like hope found its way in.

Sleep took him gently.

Rygar stayed awake.

He pressed his palm to the wound at his side, where blood, tinged black, had slowly begun to seep from the wrap. The fire had dwindled to faint embers, and the forest had gone still again.

Just before he closed his eyes, he caught a flicker in the trees. A glint of red, too intense to be anything natural.
Rygar said nothing.

He simply watched, and waited.
