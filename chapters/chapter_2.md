# Chapter 2: "The Journey to Windmoore"

Dawn broke across the sky in muted shades of gray, the sun's light filtered through a veil of ash that clung stubbornly to the air. Cassian sat hunched at the base of a charred tree, the ground beneath him hard and unyielding, a reminder of all that had been lost. The forest, once alive with whispers of wind and the scent of pine, now lay in silent ruin, the aftermath of the beast raid still fresh in the air.

Rygar moved with deliberate care, his breaths shallow as he checked the perimeter of their makeshift camp. Despite his injuries, he exuded a quiet authority, every movement purposeful. Cassian watched him through a haze of exhaustion, his mind replaying the horrors of the previous night. Flames licking at the night sky, shadows moving with terrifying speed, the screams...

"Quiet. Pack only what you can carry," Rygar instructed, his voice low but firm. "We leave no trail."

Cassian nodded, his movements mechanical. His hands were steady, but his heart was not. As he gathered what little they had salvaged, images of his family flickered behind his eyes—his mother's gentle smile, his sister's teasing laughter. They were gone, swallowed by the inferno, and all he had left were ashes and memories.

With a final look at the remnants of his home, Cassian shouldered his pack. The weight was unfamiliar, yet comforting in its solidity. It grounded him, gave him something to hold onto as the world he knew crumbled around him.

"We should reach Windmoore in a few days if we push." Rygar's words were a lifeline, pulling Cassian from the depths of his despair. 

The journey through the withered woods was a silent one, each step a reminder of the devastation left in the wake of the demonic beasts. The path was treacherous, littered with debris and the sickly-sweet scent of decay. Cassian walked with his head down, counting his steps, the rhythm a small comfort.

Rygar's condition worsened as they traveled, his cough deepening, a wet, rattling sound that spoke of internal damage. Cassian watched him with growing concern, the older man's resilience a stark contrast to his own burgeoning fear.

"Why didn't the wards hold?" Cassian's question hung in the air between them, a challenge and a plea.

Rygar paused, leaning heavily on a nearby tree as he caught his breath. "We didn't have the Jade," he admitted, his voice edged with bitterness. "The orders came from above. They knew we were vulnerable."

"Who?" Cassian pressed, his voice a mix of anger and desperation. "Who would do this?"

Rygar's eyes met his, a silent warning clear in their depths. "Don't speak his name here, lad. Some truths are best left unspoken."

The weight of Rygar's words settled heavily on Cassian. He nodded, understanding that the world was far more dangerous than he had ever imagined. With each passing mile, Cassian's resolve hardened, tempered by grief and the need for answers.

As night fell, they made camp beneath the shelter of a rock outcropping. The air was cold, a sharp contrast to the warmth of the fire they dared not light. Cassian tended Rygar's wounds with care, his hands gentle as he examined the corruption spreading from the gash. The older man watched him with a patient gaze, offering guidance and advice when needed.

"You've got a good heart, lad," Rygar said, his voice softening. "And a strong will. You'll need both in the days to come."

Cassian nodded, grateful for the encouragement. He listened intently as Rygar spoke of the Royal Wind Military Academy, of the path to becoming a Mystic and the trials one must endure. The stories were a welcome distraction, a glimpse of a future he had never dared to dream of.

"Could someone like me really become a Mystic?" Cassian asked, his voice tinged with hope.

Rygar smiled, a flicker of warmth in his tired eyes. "Anyone can, if they're willing to sacrifice and endure. It's not about where you start, but how you choose to rise."

The night passed in fits and starts, punctuated by the sounds of distant movement. Cassian lay awake, his mind racing with possibilities, the spark of determination growing into a steady flame.

Just before dawn, Rygar shook him awake, urgency in his voice. "We need to move. Now."

Cassian was on his feet in an instant, adrenaline banishing the remnants of sleep. They packed quickly, silently, the weight of unspoken fears driving them forward. As they set off, Cassian cast one last look back at the shadows behind them, feeling the prickle of unseen eyes.

"We can't stop now," Rygar urged, his pace unsteady but determined. "Windmoore awaits."

And so they pressed on, the distant lights of the city a beacon in the darkness, a promise of safety and new beginnings. But with each step, Cassian knew the journey was only just beginning.

# Chapter 2: The Journey to Windmoore

Ash still hung on the wind at dawn, settling in silent drifts over what had once been forest. Cassian sat with knees drawn tight to his chest, his boots blackened with soot, watching the world bleed from darkness into a pale, bruised light. Where old pines and birches should have rustled stories of morning, nothing moved except the cold breeze, sifting through half-burned branches. Beneath him, the earth felt hollowed through—not dead, but wounded, like he was.

Rygar stirred beside a snag of twisted roots, shaking sleep—or what passed for it—off his battered frame. Even in the chill, sweat lined his brow. He eased himself upright with a grunt barely louder than the sifting wind, hands gripping the haft of his blade as he ran a slow arc, eyes sharp though blood oozed, rust-dark, through the bandages at his side.

Cassian’s gaze wavered to his own hands, rough with dirt but steady. He remembered being pulled from the flames by those hands, remembered the way they had failed to save anyone else. The memory struck sharper than any cold.

Rygar’s voice broke the silence, low and precise. “We can’t leave footprints easy to follow. Quiet now. Pack only what you must. Nothing more.”

The order moved through Cassian like a current. He unfolded stiff limbs and forced himself to kneel at the pile of salvaged belongings: a tattered cloak, battered canteen, the smooth-worn hilt of a knife, a parcel of blackened bread. Each item set his thoughts awash in ghosts. His mother’s blanket—what was left of it—was singed, still faint with her lavender soap. His sister’s laugh rung in memory with the patter of wind-chimes, gone as suddenly as the firestorm. He blinked hard, jaw rigid, and stuffed the remnants into his pack.

He did not speak—not when Rygar shouldered his own, heavier burden, nor when they turned from the ruined camp into the silent reach of the wood’s edge. He simply followed, senses dull but movements crisp, as if numbness had trained him in obedience.

The world narrowed to the crunch of cinders beneath their feet, the ragged thunder of Rygar’s breathing, and the black traces where colossal beast tracks pressed the soil deep as gravestones. Here and there, strips of red cloth marked the vanishings—Ranger insignia ripped half into mud, charred scraps of talisman wards dashed under monstrous claws.

After a time, when the gray had brightened toward white and the sun seemed little more than a brighter smudge behind the haze, Rygar halted by a toppled birch. He coughed—a muted, choking sound—into his fist, turning away to let the fit pass.

Cassian waited, still as the trees, fingers worrying the frayed hem of his cloak. He did not look at Rygar’s wounds. Instead, he counted the thready gusts shivering through the burnt needles, the rhythm giving shape to his fear. One, two, three... Anything to keep from seeing the scorched remnants, the clotted black at Rygar's side.

When Rygar straightened, his voice carried a deeper gravity, words soft but unyielding. “We move north-by-west. Windmoore by the ridge. If my reckoning’s right, three nights, maybe four.” His gaze flicked to Cassian, measuring. “You keep watch behind. If you see anything—anything—say nothing, just tap my arm twice. Understood?”

Cassian’s reply caught in his throat, a frostbitten thing. He managed a nod.

They pressed into the tangled remains of the forest, single file. Rygar set the pace—deliberate, limping, unwavering. Though the older man’s shoulders slumped, every so often he turned, scanning with a predator’s caution, eyes narrow beneath the brim of his ruined cap.

For Cassian, time unraveled. Each step was both purpose and penance. The world seemed haunted. In the hush, the far-off crack of branches became the snap of fate rebounding—the whistle of a jaybird overhead a child’s scream, echoing from some memory always an arm’s length away.

After a long stretch, Rygar signaled a halt by a muddy stream, little more than a trickle through blackened reeds. He sat hard on the bank, signs of exhaustion spilling over the edges of his stoicism. His breath came labored; his face—gaunt even in youth—now looked chiseled from pale stone.

Cassian knelt beside him, uncorking the canteens. As he rinsed the crock of cold water over Rygar’s wrist, he found his voice, softer than leaves dropping onto water. “Why?” The word trembled out before he could stop it. “Why didn’t the wards hold? They... they shouldn't have gotten through. Not that many, not like that.”

Rygar’s jaw tightened. He watched the stream for a moment. “You know how wards work?” he asked, studying Cassian sidelong. “They burn Jade for fuel. Without Jade, a ward’s just lines in dirt and wishful thinking. We’d enough to set them—barely. But supply’s been thin. Not for the first year, either.”

Cassian’s grip whitened on the battered canteen. “Who decides? It shouldn’t be that way. The Council promised—”

A glint of iron entered Rygar's eyes. “Quiet.” The word was sharp as steel. “There’s ears in the trees, even now. Don’t speak of the Council, or Overseer Rane, or any name you don’t trust to the wind alone. If you want to see Windmoore, you forget those questions.”

Cassian bit off further protest, swallowing his anger along with despair—though both tasted of bile. He glanced at the torn edge of a Ranger’s scarf ground into the mud at his feet, the meaning clear: they had all been abandoned, one level or another, chewed up by decisions made far from these burnt lands.

Travel resumed, and the forest grew stranger, more hostile. Huge trees, split and blackened, leaned like toppled sentinels. The scent of old smoke and fresh blood mixed uneasily in the air. Where game trails might once have run, nothing stirred. At intervals, Rygar rested, each time propping himself against trunk or stone, breaths growing shallower, his cough more frequent. Still, he pressed them on by gesture if not word.

Cassian fell into a pattern—listening, counting, eyes darting to every movement. When a raindrop slipped down the back of his collar, he jerked as if struck, pulse hammering; only after did he register the ordinary cause. His body moved as if chased, his mind trapped partway behind.

Evening fell with purple slanting shadows. They took refuge beneath an upflung slab of granite veined with mica, veiled by brush and carefully arranged sticks disguised as fallen debris. There, Rygar set about camouflaging their camp’s edge with small wooden talismans—tokens carved with swirling cloud-marks, placed in a ring facing outward. Ranger protocol.

Cassian built bedding from dry leaves and the shredded remnants of what once was his family’s tent. They did not risk a fire. Instead, Rygar set two thumb-sized stones in the heart of camp—pressed glowstones, their light barely enough to trace faces in soft blue. Safe against beastly eyes, or so Rygar said.

Night pressed close. Rygar’s pain crept into his posture. He slumped against the stone, unbuckling his belt with trembling hands. Cassian, almost grateful for a task he could do, offered to clean the wound.

He peeled the dried, brown-stained uniform away as gently as he could. Rygar watched with grit-legged patience, biting down grunts of pain. The wound was angry—a misshapen gash, the flesh red-edged but with lines of faint black souring outward from its core. At the perimeter, the skin puckered, nerves twitching; demonic taint.

Rygar regarded it with grim acceptance. “Don’t look away, boy. You need to see what you’re up against. Demonic wounds rot deep, and there’s nothing for it outside the city’s circles. I’ll carry mine as far as I can.”

Cassian nodded, lips trembling as he sponged the wound with clean water. “Does it—will it spread?” he whispered.

“Not right away,” Rygar said, then, seeing Cassian’s expression, let weariness lapse into gentleness. “Don’t fret. Takes a hard man to kill me. Not many left of those, now.”

They fell into silence until Rygar, perhaps sensing the tension fraying Cassian’s nerves, glanced aside with a wry sideways twitch of his mouth. “You got kin anywhere, lad?” he asked.

Cassian froze, head bowed. “No one left.”

A long moment passed, and Rygar’s voice softened. “I was younger than you when I lost mine. Took the uniform straight after—Royal Wind Military Academy, frost on every stone, drills before first light until you bled from your eyes. I almost quit. First winter, I watched the old hands—they called it the ‘path inside’—slip away, one after the next. Cold, hunger, lashes, you name it. Only thing kept me alive was a grizzled bastard by the name of Commander Shen. He said… The wind’s in your bones, if you listen close. He taught me how to survive—how to make the wind sing along a blade, just enough to cut what needed cutting.”

Cassian’s gaze lifted, hungry for the story. “That’s the Mystic path?”

Rygar’s eyes brightened just a fraction. “The beginning, maybe. Anyone with a strong enough will, enough pain behind their eyes—they can sense the Qi, call it wind, spirit, life-force. First comes the Mortal Realm, where you gut it out day by day—cleansing the body, opening your senses. The ‘awakening’ isn’t a bolt of lightning. It’s more like… stretching muscles you never knew you had, until something finally sings.”

“Could…” The question fought for breath in Cassian’s chest. “Even me? Even with… after all this?”

Rygar turned the pressed glowstone in his fingers, tracing the tiny cloud-mark. “No one’s born Mystic. Not here. Not anywhere worth a damn. Nobody’s handed strength except by the world’s hardship. Break once, break twice—you build resolve. Grow from what’s broken. That’s how a path starts.”

For a heartbeat, hope flickered in Cassian’s face, fragile and unsure. “Does it hurt?” he asked quietly.

“It always hurts. Anything worth having does. But it’s not about pain—it’s about what you do with it. Serve something larger, and you just might find a door open.”

Cassian fumbled for words. “I… always wanted to see the air-ships over Gale-Crest. When I was little, I drew maps—dreamed I’d fly high enough to see the world’s edge.”

Rygar’s smile was ghostly, but full of pride. “Keep that in your heart. Dreams have power—so does grief, if you let them shape you.”

Later, after patching the wound and sharing a mouthful of hard bread, they lay in uneasy silence. Sleep for Cassian came in shallow fits, broken by the imagined crackle of flames, the memory of hands reaching that were no longer there.

Before sunrise, the camp shifted—the rhythm of night broken by a new, sharper tension. Rygar bolted upright, face drawn, his pulse racing under too-cold skin. He motioned sharply to Cassian, no words needed: danger.

Cassian jolted awake, hand clutching instinctively for his knife.

Rygar’s whisper was a razor’s edge. “Pack fast—no noise.”

Their hands moved in swift coordination. Cassian rolled the bedding, snapped shut the satchel, took both packs when Rygar wavered. His heart thudded, but for the first time, fear took the shape of purpose.

Night’s hush was broken only by distant rustlings—a weight in the darkness that felt more sentient than any beast. At the perimeter of their old camp, a glint—red or maybe mottled gold—shined from behind a bramble. Cassian froze, throat tight. A breath. Then it vanished.

Rygar gripped his shoulder. “No more nights in the wild. We make for Windmoore. Sunrise or nothing.”

They ascended a stony ridge as the first hints of dawn touched the distant horizon. Far ahead, through the haze, a smudge of golden light pulsed against the murky sky—Windmoore, city of hope and blade-edged uncertainty.

Cassian’s muscles burned, but dread was mixed with something altogether different now: a promise made wordless in the marrow of his bones. If I stop, he thought, I’m as dead as the rest. I’ll find strength. I swore it.

Behind them, the shadows pressed close. Ahead, Windmoore beckoned—sanctuary, or the place where the storm truly began.
