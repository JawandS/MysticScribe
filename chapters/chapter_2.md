Chapter 2: The Journey to Windmoore

/* /* /*

Dawn crept hesitantly across the blackened skeletons of the forest, dragging a bleak day behind it, the kind where hope faltered in the chill between breaths. Cassian woke all at once. There was no drifting out of sleep for him anymore—one moment he was lost in burning buildings and silent screams, the next he felt the ache in his bones, the roughness of cold earth against his face.

He sat up, wiped at his muddy eyes. The remnants of the fire had faded to a stain of ash, only the persistent memory of heat lingering in his hands. Rygar was already stirring, clumsy and careful both, his movements stiff as he checked the bandages on his side. The wound wept, dark and ugly, a thing born of monsters and left to fester by men who couldn't heal it.

Cassian’s thoughts fractured like a field of glass. He didn’t look directly at Rygar—guilt turned him away, as if it was he who should apologize for the wound, or for surviving at all.

“We need to move,” Rygar said, voice scraping as if smoothed by years of gravel and loss. It wasn’t a suggestion. Cassian nodded, feeling foolish for hesitating, foolish for everything.

They gathered their things in silence. No one spoke of what was left behind. Even the burned-out trees seemed to lean away from memory.

Cassian couldn’t tell if the forest itself mourned or merely recoiled from what had happened. Each footstep was a trespass.

He caught a breath—felt the weight of ash in his lungs, as if he could never quite draw a clean lungful again. His mind itched with everything left unsaid.

They pushed on, shadows trailing them like persistent regrets. Early morning light fell soft and weak, as if the sun, too, grieved for the dead.

Rygar moved with stubborn determination, leaning into the pain at his side, his face a stone mask. Cassian trailed after, ears straining for any sound the emptiness wasn’t hiding.

Hours bled by. Sometimes Rygar stopped, bracing himself against a tree, breath coming quick and sharp. Cassian offered a hand wordlessly; sometimes Rygar took it, sometimes he just waved it away, his pride as battered as his body.

When they found a stream—too shallow for fish, barely more than a mirror for the ruined canopy—Cassian crouched by the water, cupped trembling palms, splashed his face.

The cold stung him awake, briefly. He felt Rygar’s gaze.

“Why didn’t the wards hold?” Cassian asked. His voice surprised him—small and dry, like something scraped from the bottom of a well.

Rygar hesitated. “We didn’t get the Jade to power the detection formation.” His gaze fixed somewhere distant, haunted by old failures. “Couldn’t afford it.”

Cassian tasted anger, quick and bitter. “Who’s fault—”

“Overseer Rane.” Rygar cut him off, name falling heavy as a stone into the stream. “Don’t go asking more. Rane’s the kind who never forgets a name—or a grudge.”

Cassian’s jaw clenched. Rane. The name sat in his head like a splinter. For a moment, images flashed—charred beams, his sister’s laughter snuffed out in smoke, the sudden, brutal silence.

He wanted to storm Windmoore’s gates, shout guilt and blame until someone answered for what had happened. But he wasn’t that boy. Not anymore.

He glanced at Rygar, saw not just the pain of the wound but the fatigue etched deep by years of command and compromise. Cassian’s anger cooled into the first hint of resolve. If he had no home, perhaps he could make something else of his grief.

They rested by the stream. Rygar drank, coughed, pressed a trembling hand to his ribs. Cassian watched him, afraid to say what he was thinking. What if Rygar’s wound was more than the village healer could manage? What if they were already too late?

He closed his eyes, trying to summon memories of comfort. His mother’s voice, the warmth of the fire pit—gone. He opened them to cold water and a friend who might not see another dawn.

“We should keep moving,” he said. His voice was steady, if only because he willed it so.

Rygar managed half a smirk. “You’ll make a soldier yet.”

The sun retreated, hiding behind a haze of smoke and distant threat. Branches overhead rattled in a fretful wind, their dead leaves whispering secrets Cassian couldn’t quite catch.

Camp was a rough patch of earth beneath the splintered remnants of what might once have been a proud oak. Rygar laid wards with trembling fingers, etched the perimeter with faded talismans. He muttered under his breath—prayers or curses, Cassian couldn't tell.

Cassian unwrapped the bandages. The wound was angry: flesh swollen, shot through with black, spiderwebbing veins that pulsed with every heartbeat. The sight froze him.

He tried to clean it, hands careful but clumsy. Rygar gritted his teeth, let out sharp breaths. The silence grew heavy and awkward.

“Did you leave anyone behind?” Rygar asked, voice softer than before, almost gentle.

Cassian shook his head, throat tight. “They were all there. When the fire... all of them.”

Rygar nodded, eyes closing for a moment. “Everyone has a loss that won’t let them be,” he said, voice roughened by old scars. “When I was your age, I wanted to fly sky-ships. Dreams never survived long out where I grew.”

Cassian blinked, caught off guard by the turn in conversation. Rygar rarely spoke of the past. The mention of the Academy—Royal Wind, the name burning dimly in the back of Cassian’s memory—opened a fissure in the silence.

“It taught you how to fight?” Cassian asked, tentative.

“It taught me discipline,” Rygar said, drawing the word out as if it weighed more than a blade. “Showed me how to push past what I thought I could endure. And when you go further than you thought possible... you find out who you really are.”

Cassian wondered what he would find, if pushed. Fear twisted in his chest. Not just of dying, or failing Rygar, but of surviving—of what kind of person would be left if everything else was burned away.

Rygar caught his look. “Strength isn’t just muscle and steel. It’s surviving when you want to break. It’s finding a reason to get up every time the world knocks you down.”

Cassian nodded, not sure if he understood, but wanting to believe.

Somewhere in the darkness, a branch snapped—a predator, or the forest reminding them that not every survivor in the ashes was human.

Rygar’s hand closed around Cassian’s shoulder, fierce for a man so weakened. “Quiet,” he hissed.

Cassian’s heart pounded, blood hot in his ears. He fumbled for the little dagger they’d salvaged, its edge dull but real in his sweaty grip.

They waited. The night pressed close, silent for a heartbeat, then two. In the hollow between breaths, Cassian caught movement—a glint, red as a coal, blinking from deep between the trunks.

Was it an animal? He wanted to believe, but he’d seen beasts twisted by demonic energies. Hunger and torment made them clever, made their patience terrifying.

Rygar’s fingers twitched, reaching for the formation stones at his belt—too slow, Cassian knew, if something charged.

Then the eye blinked and vanished. The forest exhaled, all at once, filling the hollow with the sound of wind, so much like the night before—so much like the world was holding them in suspense.

Rygar whispered, “No more nights in the open.”

Cassian found his voice. “We’ll make Windmoore. We have to.”

Rygar nodded, pain written in every creased line of his face. “If not—”

“Don’t,” Cassian said, sharper than he meant. “I won’t let that happen.”

Rygar smiled, a glint of pride or hope—Cassian couldn’t tell which—briefly washing over the lines of worry.

They broke camp, packs thrown hastily over shoulders, and began the slow, cautious climb through tangled roots and the burnt detritus of lost lives.

The world narrowed to footsteps, to the crunch of soil underfoot and the steady pulse of resolve in Cassian’s chest. Each breath was a reminder: he was alive; Rygar was alive. It was enough, for now.

Through a narrow gap between blasted trunks, Cassian caught it: a flicker, distant and golden, threading through the haze. Windmoore—its lights survived the night.

He drew breath, feeling his grief solidify into something sharper. If Rane was there, if questions had answers—then tomorrow would come, shaped by whatever Cassian did tonight.

“If I stop now, I’m as dead as the rest,” he thought, letting determination settle like armor around his fear. “I’ll find out what it means to keep going.”

They crested the ridge as the first glow of Windmoore’s lanterns pierced the gloom. Cassian squared his shoulders, the weight of memory and purpose heavy, but his steps no longer hollow.

“I’m coming,” he whispered to the night—to Windmoore, to his dead, to whatever came next.

Behind him, Rygar straightened, following into an uncertain dawn.

The journey truly began.
