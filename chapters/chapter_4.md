Chapter 4: Echoes in Stone

The letter was sealed with wax pressed deep in the shape of a dragon’s head, the ridge of its brow stamped so sharply it seemed to peer through parchment. Cassian held it in both hands until his trembling steadied and his breath came long and slow.

Rygar’s badge lay on the windowsill where the nurse had set it, mercy and punishment both. The narrow infirmary window let in a lean light. Wind played with the edge of metal and sent a thin blink along its rim. He almost reached to cover it, then stopped himself. Do not hide light.

He swallowed and glanced at the doorway. The messenger Ranger watched him with a guarded patience that promised she would leave soon and that what came next would be his alone. Her green sash was scuffed. Road dust rimmed her boots. When he met her eyes she gave a single nod—a soldier’s acknowledgment—and slipped out, the door whispering closed.

Alone again, he thumbed the seal. No turning away. He cracked it and read.

To the bearer of the Ranger’s badge, by order of High Deacon Serise Maerin, you are summoned to the Sanctum Court of Windmoore to deliver testimony of border events and present items of proof. Come as you are able by sundown.

Sundown. The light in the narrow window had the late slant that meant shadows would soon be longer than men. His thumb found the last line again. As you are able. Rygar would have snorted and told him to move his feet.

Cassian closed his eyes. He pictured Rygar as he had last seen him, blood-soaked and smiling that grim smile that was half challenge and half farewell. Run, Rygar had said, voice like gravel under a boot. Church. Badge. The truth, boy—no names cast like darts without proof. If the world is rotten, it will rot on its own. Do not let it take you with it.

He tucked the letter under his shirt and reached for the badge. The metal was cool, just weighty enough to comfort. He rubbed a smudge away with his sleeve as he had done on long dull afternoons when the world had been whole. His lips moved on their own, shaping Sister Ana’s hymn from the old village green.

Wind that bears the prayer, carry truth and ash to dawn, keep the weak from despair, keep the strong from doing wrong.

The nurse caught him at it. She came in with a folded cloak over one arm, stern face softened by the sight of the badge in his hands and the set of his mouth. “You mean to go, then.”

“Yes.” His voice was rough. Grief lived in his throat like smoke and still let him speak. “By sundown.”

She clucked her tongue and set the cloak at his feet. “You are barely mended. The city can swallow boys like you in a single breath.” Her gaze flicked to the window, to the pale slice of mountains beyond the roofs. “And there is wind today. The streets make eddies where thieves like to fish.”

He straightened. His legs ached. His ribs flared when he stood too quickly. His body obeyed anyway. “I do not have time to mend soft. He gave me this. I have to carry it where it must go.”

“The Deacon’s court is no warm hearth,” she said quietly, using his name for the first time. “Innocence means little if you stammer. Men there hear a hundred stories a day and doubt ninety-nine.” She studied him and nodded to herself. “All the same, he trusted you. That counts for something where I come from.”

He kept still as she eased the cloak over his shoulders and tied the clasp. The fabric smelled faintly of lye and lavender. Home had smelled of sap and smoke and pine needles crushed underfoot. This was sharper, cleaner, the scent of rules and polished floors and people who belonged.

“Hold your head up,” the nurse said. “If you look like you know your business, most folk will not test you. If they do, show them that.” Her eyes went to the badge.

“I will return it,” he said, surprising himself. “When I can.”

Her mouth thinned. “You may not have that choice. The Church holds what it deems sacred until it is done.” She tilted her head. “You remember the hymn. Speak it under your breath if your heart skitters. Better to fill your mouth with courage than silence.”

He bowed, awkward but heartfelt. “Thank you.”

“Go on, then,” she said, shooing him with the edge of her hand. “Follow the dragon banners. If any Sentinel stops you, keep your words plain and stop your feet.”

He rested his palm on the badge, tucked it under his cloak where his fingers could find it, and walked out.

The abbey threshold weighed like stone and shadow, and then he was in Windmoore proper. The city smelled of bread and smoke and wet stone and felt like a river he had been thrown into. Noise surged around him—donkey carts, hawkers crying, the clang of hammers down a lane—and above it, a whisper of wind threading alleys like invisible cats.

Cassian squared his shoulders and stepped into the flow.

He counted gusts without meaning to. Three between the bakery and the square—flour dust danced in their wake. Two between the square and a fountain where a worn dragon carved into the pedestal stared sightlessly at shallow coin-scattered water. He slid through the press of bodies with surprising ease for a boy raised where cows outnumbered people. The new lean in him, carved by hunger and grief and running, made him nimble.

He kept his eyes up. Dragon banners hung from carved poles at the mouths of broader streets. He followed the banners.

Over the rooftops, the mountains lay blue-gray and aloof. Closer rose the Church complex, taller than most roofs, all storm-gray stone. Arches hung with chimes flickered and sang when a breeze threaded them. His chest eased a fraction at the familiar austerity: slanted roofs that drew rain in clean lines toward an inner court, scripture inlaid with pale jade along door lintels.

The city swallowed him and offered him up to the court’s doors.

He stopped at the foot of the steps and let himself be small. The doors were carved from a single dark wood, smoothed by uncounted hands. Sigils set into their frames glowed faintly like breath on winter air. People thronged the steps. Mortals in plain coats, faces pinched with worry, clutched papers and small carved boxes. Others in better cloth stared past the crowd with the calm of those who expect to be answered. On a side balcony, two figures in gray breastplates stood with the ease of Mystics, their armor sigiled: Sentinels assigned to Church grounds.

And there—cutting like fish through a deeper current—Inquisitors in white, eyes like knives that did not need blood. Faces pale and expressionless beneath cowls. Cassian’s hand found the badge where it lay warm from his skin. He did not clutch it. He only felt its edge and heard Rygar. Keep your head up.

The hymn rose to his lips like breath. Wind that bears the prayer—

He passed a man arguing with a clerk about a missing tithe box, a woman pleading for a son arrested for fighting on a holy day, a bent-backed alchemist asking after fees. Their voices washed by him. He climbed. No one stopped him.

At the doors, a boy in a novice’s white lifted his chin. He looked twelve, an ink smudge on his cheek. “Business?”

Cassian drew the letter from his shirt and held it out. “Summoned,” he said. “By High Deacon Serise Maerin. I have a badge to present.”

The novice’s eyes widened at the seal. “Stand under the arch. Do not block the line.” He snapped his fingers twice. A woman in plain Deacon gray turned her head.

She came with the step of someone with too much to do and no patience for fools. Her gaze skimmed his face, dropped to the badge, sharpened, and rose again. “You are young.”

“Yes, Deacon,” he said, not knowing her rank but choosing respect. Better to honor false rank than slight true.

Her mouth twitched, almost a smile. “Name?”

“Cassian Graves.”

“Ash and wind,” she muttered, whether at him or the day he could not tell. “Let me see.”

He offered the letter without letting go of the badge with his other hand. She read swiftly, lips moving, and exhaled through her nose. “All right.” She glanced over his shoulder. “Brother Kehl.”

A man peeled out of the white-cowled line and came toward them like a shadow deciding to be a man. His cowl did not hide the pale scar that cut from left eye to jaw. He was not old, but his eyes were older than the stones. He stopped a pace away, made no attempt at courtesy. “Yes.”

“Summons from the High Deacon,” the woman said. She handed him the letter. “He claims a Ranger badge.”

“He would not be the first boy to steal one off a corpse,” Brother Kehl said. His gaze fell to the fold of Cassian’s cloak as if it could look through wool. “Many have claimed titles since the southern villages burned. Why heed a boy with a badge?”

His tone was not cruel. It was worse: indifferent. Cassian’s hand tightened until the metal’s edge bit his palm. A flash of red washed his vision—his sister reaching for him with soot-blackened fingers. Not here. Not now. He swallowed and counted wind. One gust licked the chimes. Two slid past his cheek. Three tugged the edge of someone’s cloak below.

He drew breath. “Because Corporal Rygar Stormwake of the Ranger Corps gave it to me. Because I promised him I would bring it here. Because I can speak the Ranger’s oath even though I am not a Ranger and never was.”

Brother Kehl’s head tipped by a fraction, like a cat hearing an unfamiliar sound.

Cassian spoke, eyes on the Inquisitor’s. “Strength to guard the wilds. Silence to keep what must be kept. Witness to the lost. Mercy for the fallen. Truth to the Throne.” The words came halting, then clean as he found the cadence Rygar had used the night they had sheltered under a broken pine and listened to wolves. He had thought it beautiful then without understanding half its weight.

The Deacon woman made that nearly-smile again, approval in it now. Brother Kehl’s scar pulled tight. He skimmed the letter and made a small motion with his hand. “Very well.” His voice stayed cool. “Come. The High Deacon will judge your claim herself.”

Cassian nodded and followed.

They passed through the carved doors into an echoing hall that smelled of old incense, hot wax, and polished stone. Pale light washed from high windows set with blue glass. A mosaic of the First Emperor covered the floor, his hand on a dragon’s muzzle, gaze turned outward. Cassian stepped around the Emperor’s foot because it felt wrong to tread on it and because the wind in the hall swirled in odd ways that suggested the path.

Brother Kehl walked without slowing. Cassian followed. The Deacon woman came a step behind.

They passed doors where lesser judgments were held, voices like tides, weeping, angry pleas, the even tones of clergy. They passed a library propped open to let cool air stroke shelves and people dusting books within. They passed a prayer room where a handful of monks knelt and the air was so still the wind outside seemed louder for it.

At last, Brother Kehl stopped at a smaller door banded in iron. The sigil above it was not the dragon, but a laughing wind-fox with a scroll in its teeth. “The High Deacon is within,” he said. “Do not lie.”

“Good counsel,” the Deacon woman murmured, dry.

“I do not lie,” Cassian said, then wished he had phrased it less bluntly. He thought of Rygar’s last warning. No names without proof. He would have to walk a narrow path.

Brother Kehl opened the door and stood aside.

The chamber was smaller than he expected and grander in ways that had nothing to do with size. A table of dark wood held a scribe with a brush poised over paper, a sand-tray by his elbow. Shelves held artifacts: old Ranger banners singed and mended; wind-burnished swords that looked used more than displayed; sealed boxes marked with sigils Cassian did not know. A tall window faced west. The light was pewter gray. Clouds had shouldered up over the mountains while he walked.

At the far end stood the High Deacon.

She was not tall. She did not need to be. She held herself like someone who knew where her feet were and why. Her hair was iron-gray cut blunt at her jaw, her eyes a darker steel. Her robe was a simple deep gray like the outer courts’ stones, but a pale stole embroidered with wind and dragon lay over her shoulders. Cassian had never seen anyone so ordinary and so formidable in the same breath.

“Cassian Graves,” she said, not asking. Her voice was exact.

He bowed stiffly. “High Deacon.”

“You are in pain and have been running for days,” she said. “You will sit. You will drink.” She nodded. An acolyte who had stood so quietly by a screen that Cassian had not noticed him stepped forward with a cup. He pressed it into Cassian’s hand and retreated.

Cassian drank because she had told him to and because his throat was raw. It was not water. It tasted faintly of lemon and a brittle herb that made his tongue tingle. A clean heat spread as he swallowed.

“Good,” the High Deacon said softly. “Now. Brother Kehl has brought you on a summons. You claim a badge and a story. Truth is flame, boy. Hold to it, or be consumed.”

He put the cup down with both hands so he would not spill. The room had a pressure to it, subtle but real, like the weight a storm lays on skin. It was the High Deacon. She was testing him the way storms test trees.

He drew breath slowly, counted a gust he could not feel, and began.

He told them about the village as it had been, a breath’s worth only—the ridge beyond, saws early, his mother’s bread, his sister squealing when rain bounced off her nose. It was necessary to say that before the rest. He told them how night fell wrong, quick and suffocating, how the first scream had sounded like an animal and then like a person. The scribe’s brush rasped soft on paper. Brother Kehl’s scar was a white line. The High Deacon’s eyes did not leave his face.

He told them about the beasts. Not everything. What he remembered through smoke and panic: shapes too many things at once—hounds with mirrors where eyes should be; long-limbed creatures that moved like spider and man; something larger at the center of the street, shadow coiled around something lean and terrible. Fires burned and did not consume at first. The air tasted copper-sour. A cry seemed to come from under the ground.

He told them about his family. His voice caught. He did not break. The wind at the window licked the sill and withdrew. He told them about Rygar, the way he had come out of the smoke like a piece of night given human shape, dragging him forward, saying his name over and over to keep him in his body. He told them about running, the bite of thorns, the howl of hounds, the rattle in Rygar’s breath when they stopped to bind a wound.

He did not speak the name Rygar had whispered under rock while the world hunted them. He did not say Overseer. He did not say Rane. He spoke of funding diverted, wards weakened by neglect, men in power who had forgotten what power was for. “He suspected rot. He did not tell me names. He told me to bring the badge and the story and let the Church do its work.”

The pressure thickened, then eased. The High Deacon’s mouth thinned. “The wards fell without warning?”

“Yes.” He made himself meet her gaze. “The village stones were inscribed. Old but tended. Our elder watched them like a hawk. On the day, the stones flickered, went dark, and then the world came in. Rygar said—” He paused, ashamed of his uncertainty. “I do not know if I understood. He said the weave was thin as a beggar’s boot heel. He looked at the sigil on the old marker near the wood-lane and cursed like I have never heard a man curse. Then he told me to run.” He swallowed. “I did.”

He spoke of the hounds on the ridge near Windmoore, the way Rygar had turned, the moment his own feet refused to move and Rygar struck him a glancing blow that knocked thought out of him long enough to obey. He spoke of running and a sensation like a curtain lifting—the first whisper of something in his blood stirring to greet the wind. He said it simply, as if confessing a theft. He had not earned anything. Why should something awaken in him while Rygar bled.

The High Deacon listened, eyes half-lidded as if following wind in a familiar place. The scribe wrote. Brother Kehl’s hands were folded but not at rest. One thumb traced the line of a scar on the other.

When he finished, the room was quiet except for the brush’s soft rasp. The wind had died. The pewter light went darker. Rain would come before midnight.

The High Deacon nodded once, a small thing that lifted weight off him gently. “There are patterns in this that I do not like,” she said. “And others I have seen before and like less.”

“High Deacon,” Brother Kehl said, measured as ever, “if the wards failed city-wide—”

“They did not,” she said. “But in the past three weeks I have had reports of knots in the weave where there should be rope. Someone is cutting. Or letting moths eat. The difference matters to gods and lawyers. It does not matter to the dead.” She looked at Cassian again. “You held to truth under pressure. When an Immortal calls down a gale on your mind, that is no small thing.” A flicker passed her mouth, not unkind. “You are not safe to walk alone with what you carry.”

He blinked, startled. “I—” Shame rose as if every good thing given him would be mislaid. “I do not mean to be a burden.”

“Child,” she said, and the word did not diminish him, only set him rightly in the whirl of things, “every soul in this city is a burden. We carry each other or we break. Be silent.” She lifted a hand to cut off apology. “Your testimony is taken. It will be duplicated and sent through channels holy and secular. The Church will investigate. In times of shadow, Windmoore must discern where loyalty lies.” The pale stole shifted as she turned, dragon embroidery catching light. “If your words hold—and I believe they do—then you may find a place among the faithful… or something more.” Her gaze fell to his chest. “You have the wind in you. That is its own path.”

Heat flushed his face. He did not know what to do with hope when it did not mock. He rubbed the badge’s edge with his thumb under the cloak. The High Deacon’s gaze followed.

“The badge,” she said softly. “He gave it to you.”

“Yes.”

“It will need sanctification. There is spilt blood in its hollows and shadow on its edge. If we are to carry it into the light of the Court in due time, it must be washed.” She held out her hand. “Will you surrender it?”

His fingers clenched without meaning to. Metal bit a groove into his skin that would be there for hours. Rygar had warmed this badge with his hands. He had pinned it on with triumph. He had thrown it like a lifeline. To hand it away felt like stepping off a cliff into air he had trusted for only a day.

He closed his eyes. If the wind called him, it called him to step. Rygar’s voice was steady in his head. Church. Badge. Truth. “Yes,” he said aloud, because if he did not, he might not do it.

He drew the badge from his cloak and laid it on her palm. Her fingers closed gently, not triumphant, like a ritual without taking. “We will make it clean,” she said. “You may take it again when it is right.” She did not say when. Perhaps there was no when. Perhaps that was the test: would he walk without the weight of the only thing left of his old life, trusting it to another’s keeping, trusting himself to move forward without it.

Brother Kehl stepped to her side. His eyes warmed a single degree. Not enough for anyone without eyes for storms to see, but Cassian saw.

“You will be housed for the night,” the High Deacon said, placing the badge in a shallow wooden dish beside a burnt censer. “The guest cells will suffice. You will be brought a meal and a basin. In the morning, if the rain is not hard, I will send for you again. If it is hard, I will send for you anyway. The rain is not an excuse.”

“Yes, High Deacon.” He rose clumsily. Ache settled behind his eyes. His legs were heavy. “Thank you.”

Brother Kehl inclined his head. “Come.”

He followed the white cowl into a quieter corridor. Stone floors worn by generations. No mosaics here, only plain woven mats and gray walls. He counted gusts—one where the corridor opened to a small inner court with a stunted tree bowed by wind; two at a turn where a slit window poked a finger of air at his shoulder as if to remind him to pay attention; three as Brother Kehl paused and pushed open a door.

“Here,” the Inquisitor said, stepping aside.

The guest cell had gray-stone walls, a pallet on a low frame, a folded blanket, a wooden stool repaired so often the repairs were more wood than original, a narrow window slit offering a slice of rooftops and one slanted piece of sky. It held the city’s overhear the way a shell holds sea sound—muted and without particular.

“You will remain,” Brother Kehl said. “If you attempt to leave, there will be questions. Not punishments, not yet. Questions. Eat, sleep, do not run.”

“I will not,” Cassian said softly. “There is nowhere to run to.”

To his surprise, Brother Kehl’s mouth eased a hair. “There is always somewhere to run. There is seldom somewhere to run wisely. Stay, boy.” He turned and was gone.

Left alone, Cassian stood in the little cell and let breath shudder out of his bones. The walls loomed, settled, became only walls. He sat on the pallet because his knees told him to. He did not lie down. If he lay down before eating, he might not rise. Sleep would bring teeth.

An acolyte came as the light thinned, a girl about his age with a braid glossy as crow feather and flour on her hands. She set a tray on the stool: thick barley stew with hunks of carrot and onion and a few unidentifiable bits of meat, a heel of brown bread, a wedge of white cheese, a cup of water. She did not look at him directly. Her gaze skated to corners and floor. When she bowed it was the barest dip.

“Thank you,” he said.

“You are welcome,” she whispered. Then, unable to help herself: “Did you really run from hounds? I heard—”

“Aila,” someone hissed from the corridor, a voice that held a smile inside a scold. “Do not chatter.”

The girl bit her lip, ducked, and left. The door sighed closed.

Cassian ate because he had been told and because he was starving. He would have been content with a mouthful of bread alone. The stew tasted of smoke and root and warmth. The cheese was bland and kind. When the bowl was empty, his hands had steadied and his shoulders had loosened. He set the tray aside and rose.

He went to the window and set his fingertips on the sill. The stone was colder than he expected. Outside, rooftops layered like scales on a sleeping beast. Beyond them, a wisp of mountain gathered a hood of cloud. Below, in some court or alley he could not see, somebody laughed with the relief of finishing a long task before rain. He closed his eyes.

West-facing window. No matter. He was not bound to bells. He was a boy with a heart that would not stop and a promise he had not yet let time crush under heel. He set his feet and let breath come like bellows. In. Out. He counted. One gust along the slit. Two.

He shaped Sister Ana’s words into breath and let them carry his mind.

Wind that bears the prayer…

It was not magic. It was the oldest thing he owned—attention given to the world and his own blood. The stir at his sternum rose again, not like a wave but like a bird testing wing. There was no wind to move a chime, and still he felt currents within the room, tiny, like fish in a pool circling lazy in heat. When he breathed in, they tugged at the edge of awareness. When he breathed out, they carried away grit lodged under his heart.

He did not force. Rygar had said, teaching him to make fire in wet wood, You coax. You never beat the spark into heat. You use breath. He coaxed with breath, and the something in him turned its head and looked at him. He looked back.

His knees softened. He sank to the pallet and set his hands on his thighs. He did not know the proper names of channels or gates. He only knew the sense of it. He sat and breathed and knew he was not empty. A ray of light slid along a roof edge in the slice of sky and dropped. Rain began, brief at first, then more.

Whispered voices drifted along the corridor. Acolytes at their tasks, or clerks walking the sheltered ways home. “Did you hear?” one said, mostly breath. “North ridge outposts took a beast pack two nights ago. Five dead. Three Rangers missing. They say the Astral Corps signaled late.” A pause, a susurrus like disapproval. “Promotion exams may be canceled. They will conscript out of the academy classes.”

“Rangers are stretched thin,” another replied. “They always are. Ask why and the Bureaucrats say coffers are lean and the Church says prayers are rich and neither feeds a patrol.”

“Mind your tongue,” a third warned, softly. “Walls have ears.”

The voices faded. Cassian stared at the slice of sky until it blurred. The ache behind his eyes returned, then subsided. Anger stirred low and steady, not the blaze that burned and went. If the Church acted, they could lay stones back into place. If not—he exhaled—then it would be on him to find a way to become more than a boy with a song and a badge-shaped hole in his hand. Academy. He had not known such a thing existed until Rygar, and now it felt like a path cut into slope that needed a climber.

Footsteps paused outside and went on. He felt eyes on his back and turned, but saw only stone. He pulled the blanket up over the pallet, then paused.

Someone else was in the room.

He had not heard the door. The someone had been there since the acolyte left, a narrow shadow merged with gray, lying on the second pallet. Now, as rain thickened and a thin line of water traced down the sill, the shadow shifted and became a boy his age with hair shorn plain and a healer’s sash folded under his head for a pillow. His hands were wrapped in linen, not for injury, but because he had been practicing on someone and had not washed yet. His eyes were clever and quiet.

They stared at each other a breath. The other boy looked away first, embarrassed at being caught. “Sorry,” he said, voice rough. “Did not mean to stare. You breathe like a monk.”

Cassian huffed a small laugh. The sound startled him. “I do not know how monks breathe.”

“They breathe like that.” The boy’s mouth tugged to one side. “Even when they are not trying.” He sat up. The sash slid off. He caught it and set it beside him. “I am Aron,” he said with knife-clean directness. “Novice healer. Sometimes we patch Rangers when proper healers are elsewhere. You look like a Ranger.”

“Not a Ranger,” Cassian said, the ache a live coal. He did not say yet aloud. “Cassian. I ran.”

“Running is survival until it is not,” Aron said. “Then it is only running.” He eyed the blank stone near the door and leaned back against the wall. “You gave them something important. They always put folk who give important things in the guest cells where doors creak. It lets the Inquisitors sleep.”

Cassian looked at him properly. The boy’s face held the pallor of lamp hours, but his eyes were steady. His hands, even wrapped, looked competent. The world tilted a fraction, enough to suggest not all new things were knives. “You have been here long?”

“Two months.” Aron’s hand brushed the sash, which held stains that would never quite wash out. “Dock Quarter rot. I stayed. They keep me busy. They keep my belly full. That is enough for now.”

Silence settled, the comfortable kind that comes when people have said as much as they can bear. Rain grew heavy. The chimes on the outer courts rang a soft, uneven song.

Cassian lay down at last. He pulled the blanket to his chest and set his hand flat where the badge had been. The absence weighed, and yet he felt lighter, the way a man feels when he sets down a yoke even if his shoulders still remember. He closed his eyes. The wind stirred in the corridor, along the slit window, in his chest. He let it. He counted until numbers lost shape and only breath remained.

Beyond the Church walls, the city lay like a sleeping beast. Beyond the city, mountains watched. Between, a signal tower chimed twice, faint and importunate.

If justice demands a gale, so be it, he thought, picturing Rygar’s back between him and the hounds, Brother Kehl moving like a man who had met his monsters and named them, the High Deacon’s eyes clear as winter sky that promises frost and clean air both. I will become the storm.

At the edge of sleep, the wind rose like answer. A thread of air slipped through the slit, walked light fingers along his cheek, and was gone.

He slept.

* * *

Morning came pale, with rain settled into a steady boon for farmers and a nuisance for everyone else. Bells rang somewhere in the Court—soft, persistent, the way one speaks a name to call a person back.

Cassian woke with the world he had left at his back and the world he needed to enter on the far side of the door. He washed in a basin left in the night, the water cool against grit on his face and neck. He folded the blanket and only afterward realized he had learned a habit already of making borrowed rooms neat.

Aron was gone. His pallet held no imprint. The healer’s sash had vanished too.

The Deacon woman from the steps pushed the door and stood there with her not-quite smile. “Healer novices rise before dawn and collapse after dark,” she said, as if answering his thought. “You slept like a stone.”

“I did,” Cassian admitted. Lying here would be like lighting a fire in a sanctuary. He lifted his chin as the nurse had told him. “Has the badge—?”

“In progress,” she said. “It sang in the smoke. That is a good sign.” Her gaze softened. “You did well yesterday. Do not let anyone say otherwise.” She paused, then brisk again: “High Deacon will see you after first court. You will wait here.”

“Of course.”

“Eat,” she added, gesturing to a tray another acolyte slid past her. “If you have nothing to do—and you do not—sit and breathe. It calms the wind.”

When she had gone, nothing in the room had changed and yet it felt different. The stone was still stone, the rain still rain. Cassian ate the bread, stale but softened with slices of apple and a smear of honey. He drank the water and set the cup down deliberately, the way Rygar had taught him to set down a knife—flat, handle facing where his hand would reach next.

He stood by the slit window and watched the city blur. A cart creaked down a lane, wheels complaining. From somewhere came the steady thock of a wooden practice blade striking a post, again and again, the rhythm of a boy trying to become a man or a man trying to become something more. Hunger flared bright in his chest. He set his palm to the stone to steady it.

If the Church stood with him, it was a pillar. If it did not, it was not a wall he could break now. Either way, he would not stop. He thought of the Academy. He thought of how Rygar had said the Royal as if it were both name and place to set your back against. He thought of Sentinels in gray and Inquisitors in white and the way even ordinary monks owned a stillness that made them hard to move. He thought of ashes and the badge in a smoke bowl singing.

Footsteps came again. Slower, heavier. Each step measured as if weighed. The door eased open. Brother Kehl stood there, cowl pushed back, eyes still old.

“Come,” he said simply.

Cassian stepped to the door. He kept his head up. He did not reach for the badge that was not there. He did not count the gusts between his cell and whatever chamber waited. He did not need to. The wind counted him. He could feel it gathering, a slow turn of air that did not belong to storms alone. It sat with him like a presence he had invited and that had not yet decided if it would stay.

He walked into it, and did not falter.
